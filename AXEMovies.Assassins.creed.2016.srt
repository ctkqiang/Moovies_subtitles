1
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:22,369
<i>ANDALUCIA, SPAIN
1492</i>

2
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,322
The Inquisition has finally
delivered Spain to the Templars.

3
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:03,258
Sultan Muhammad and his
people still hold out in Granada.

4
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,996
But if his son,
the prince, is captured,

5
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:09,083
he will surrender the city
and the Apple of Eden.

6
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:12,252
Do you, Aguilar de Nerha,

7
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:16,173
swear to honor our order
in the fight for freedom?

8
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:19,677
To defend mankind
against Templars' tyranny,

9
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,277
and preserve free will?

10
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:24,112
I swear.

11
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:26,782
If the Apple falls
into their hands,

12
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:29,367
the Templars will destroy
everything that stands in their way.

13
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:32,954
Protest, dissent, our right
to think for ourselves.

14
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,457
Swear to me that you
will sacrifice your life

15
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:39,071
and lives of everyone
here to keep it from them.

16
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:41,407
Yes, Mentor.

17
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,667
Our lives are nothing.

18
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,670
The Apple is everything.

19
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:58,340
The spirit of the Eagle,
will watch over the future.

20
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:22,656
Where other men blindly
follow the truth,

21
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:26,007
remember, nothing is true.

22
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:31,054
Where other men are
limited by morality or law,

23
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:35,085
remember,
everything is permitted.

24
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:43,177
We work in the darkness
to serve the light.

25
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:47,181
We are Assassins.

26
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:21,443
It's the prince.

27
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,212
Which household
harbored the boy?

28
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:47,761
Only me.

29
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:59,440
Nobody else knew.
Nobody.

30
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:04,361
Hang his family
and make him watch.

31
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:09,408
Burn the whole village.

32
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:34,364
With the prince of Granada
as captive, his father, sultan,

33
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:36,783
will surrender his
rebellious city,

34
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:39,897
the last safe haven
for the infidels.

35
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:45,083
God will punish his
people's heresy.

36
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:50,908
Finally Spain will be
under one Templar rule.

37
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,642
Stay with the memory, Cal.

38
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,150
Aguilar! The boy, Aguilar!
The boy!

39
00:26:22,552 --> 00:26:25,164
Aguilar, the boy!

40
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,150
Crazy for crying...

41
00:44:05,151 --> 00:44:07,819
Staying in synch-void
could be dangerous.

42
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:14,436
And I'm crazy for loving you...

43
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:54,560
Soon they will march on Granada.

44
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,148
Sultan Muhammad is weak.

45
00:45:00,957 --> 00:45:03,735
He'll surrender the Apple

46
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:07,906
and betray the
Creed to save the prince.

47
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:13,120
The love makes us weak.

48
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:23,270
Gladly I'll sacrifice
my flesh and blood,

49
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:26,091
for survival of the Creed.

50
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:46,278
When I die today,
don't waste your tears for me.

51
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:36,286
The Lord spoke.

52
00:46:37,845 --> 00:46:40,124
And he said:

53
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:43,752
"If a man abide not in me

54
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:46,338
he is cast into the fire

55
00:46:47,146 --> 00:46:49,675
and he is burned!"

56
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:55,597
For decades,

57
00:46:55,947 --> 00:47:00,283
you have lived in
the world torn apart

58
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:03,397
by religious discord.

59
00:47:03,496 --> 00:47:07,734
But soon, thanks to God

60
00:47:08,835 --> 00:47:11,196
and Inquisition

61
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:16,535
we will purge this disease!

62
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:27,421
The sinners before you,

63
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:31,842
sought to defend the
heretic prince of Granada,

64
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:36,319
the last heathen stronghold

65
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,266
in our holy war.

66
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:41,658
So today,

67
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:45,898
before our king and queen

68
00:47:46,122 --> 00:47:48,957
I swear we shall
wash ourselves clean,

69
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:52,529
in the holy fire of God!

70
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:58,327
Behold...

71
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:01,622
God's will!

72
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:09,421
You will watch your mentor burn
and then you will die the slowest.

73
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:26,897
Give glory to the future.

74
00:48:27,914 --> 00:48:30,234
Not to us.

75
00:49:23,678 --> 00:49:25,998
Damned heretics!

76
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,808
Don't let them escape!

77
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:26,573
For the Creed.

78
01:09:29,842 --> 01:09:32,162
Our own lives...

79
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,707
What matters is what
we leave behind.

80
01:09:52,365 --> 01:09:54,643
Sultan...

81
01:09:54,992 --> 01:09:56,743
Surrender the Apple.

82
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:59,440
Your Assassin protectors are gone.

83
01:09:59,872 --> 01:10:03,402
The Creed is finished.

84
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:46,236
My son.

85
01:11:24,665 --> 01:11:26,985
Here lies the seed

86
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,863
of man's first disobedience,

87
01:11:31,547 --> 01:11:33,867
of free will itself.

88
01:11:43,851 --> 01:11:46,630
Thanks to the Apple of Eden,

89
01:11:46,979 --> 01:11:49,299
the known world

90
01:11:49,941 --> 01:11:52,636
shall be ushered into a new age.

91
01:11:53,444 --> 01:11:55,764
One of peace,

92
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:59,783
in which all the warring
populations of mankind

93
01:11:59,784 --> 01:12:03,063
shall bow in perfect obedience

94
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,650
to our one templar rule.

95
01:13:11,814 --> 01:13:14,134
The Apple.

96
01:13:14,567 --> 01:13:16,887
Give it to him.

97
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:19,807
Now.

98
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:24,311
For the Creed.

99
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:27,434
Go!

100
01:16:28,261 --> 01:16:30,581
Forgive me.

101
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,680
It's over!

102
01:18:14,575 --> 01:18:16,895
Assassin!

103
01:20:07,522 --> 01:20:10,592
The Assassins died for it.

104
01:20:11,442 --> 01:20:13,762
Protect it with your life.

105
01:20:14,904 --> 01:20:17,266
I am a friend of the Creed.

106
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:26,483
Take it to your grave.

107
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:29,403
I swear.
