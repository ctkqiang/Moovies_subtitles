00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:41,086
Ah, Guys.

4
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:44,366
Those are chrome plated mugs.
You can not strip them.

5
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:45,686
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

6
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,326
The plating's flaked out.

7
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:48,726
<i>Yeah?</i>

8
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,006
This is on lease.
No one is gonna pay you like...

<i>Pendejo,
Cabron.</i>

10
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,046
Shit.

11
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,446
Guys, guys.

12
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:20,486
Guys, seriously
you don't wanna do this.

13
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:25,486
<i>Take him out.</i>

14
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:43,846
No,

Motherfucker!!!

17
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:36,686
Shit.

18
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:58,766
Fuck.

23
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,505
<i>Why are we still talking about mutants?</i>

24
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,732
Hey It's Me.
I'm in the car.

25
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:07,614
Yes, it was a good trip.

26
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:10,307
Tilt it up and down the fence.

Wolverine.

29
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:51,445
I knew it was you.

30
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:54,085
- Oh, fuck.
- Please!

31
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:55,651
I am in trouble!

32
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:57,914
You're the only one that could help!

33
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,045
Get the fuck away from me!

34
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,371
Please!

35
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:10,605
Logan!

36
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:16,685
Who is that?

37
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,830
I do not know, some crazy lady.
Don't worry about that.

38
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:24,486
As I live and breath,
The Wolverine.

39
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:26,885
And he is a junkie now.

40
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:28,605
Who the fuck are you?

41
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,304
You know?
You got some buck shot on your door.

42
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,125
I heard you was in Phoenix.

43
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:38,660
But then last night some friends of mine
at Texas HP

44
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,785
Told me they found 3 dead cholos
in the pool out on 54.

45
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:45,005
Not unusual,
I know.

46
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:48,437
Except one was missing a hand
another one a leg.

47
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:50,604
So they was thinking...

48
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,845
It was either an escaped tiger
or Freddy Kruger.

49
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,350
But neither one of them can drive...

50
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:59,637
One being fictional and
the other one extinct.

51
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:03,933
And since the wheel lugs they found
belong to a 24 Chrysler...

52
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:06,306
Well...

53
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,480
This is a 24 Chrysler.

54
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:12,605
She found you yet?

55
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:13,870
Gabriella?

56
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,085
You see...

57
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:19,845
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

58
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:23,798
Well, not really, I'm looking for someone
who's looking for you.

59
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:27,805
She took me something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

60
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:30,605
Something for which I am responsible.

61
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:33,445
A Mexican lady

62
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:36,395
Has its eyes on you now.

63
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,472
Doesn't ring any bells?

64
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:43,216
I don't know any Gabriella
So get the fuck out of my car.

65
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,085
You know?

66
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:49,685
I know what you hiding amigo.

67
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,965
The old Cuban south of the border

68
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:54,845
What do you want?

69
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,565
A little cooperation.

70
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,565
I'm a fan,
by the way.

72
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:17,545
Fuck! Fuck!

73
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,921
No, Miss Morales.
No.

74
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:23,652
I know I said June, but
I need the boat now,

75
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:25,656
Why would that mean
The price go up.

76
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,003
Listen to me.

77
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:29,823
I know you wanted 70...

78
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:33,145
Ok. What if I can put together $ 45,000
in cash right now?

79
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:35,114
Hello? Hello?

80
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,233
Shit.

81
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:40,584
Hey, Sam.

82
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:42,052
Good Morning.

83
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:41,000
He's having a bad day.

84
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,478
They're All bad days.

85
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,649
He needed these six hours ago.

86
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:50,630
This is not enough you know.

87
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:52,987
will see us to the week

88
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,026
I'm working on it.

89
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:57,829
Your turn.

90
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:00,274
I had a rough night.

91
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,951
Well. Poor you.

92
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:10,358
In other news, he told me last night
he was communicating with someone.

93
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:12,729
He's not talking to anybody.

94
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:13,942
Don't be so sure.

95
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,148
He has got all these details.

96
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,666
I thought that tank was supposed
to act as a barrier.

97
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:21,403
- It has gotten cracks in it.
- Please stop.

98
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:23,536
Bottom left.

99
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:31,268
You're not listening.

100
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,871
He's been asking questions again.
That why we're here.

101
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:36,314
I think he's trying to read my mind.

102
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:37,448
That's what these are for.

103
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,921
<i>Friends,
I have good news for you today!</i>

104
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:03,842
<i>It's not about what you do.</i>

105
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:07,509
<i>It's not about your deed.
You gotta give up to God.</i>

106
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,657
<i>He knows what you can't.
It's Okay, we are imperfect.</i>

107
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:15,172
Make way, sir.

108
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:17,559
I said make way!

109
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,773
<i>The new "quesalupa" from Taco Bell!</i>

110

111
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:25,997
<i>Get it with the cheescake
right in the sell.</i>

112
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:27,588
<i>It's the next big thing.</i>

113
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:29,461
<i>Call now, supplies last!</i>

114
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:32,718
Who are you?

115
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:34,222
You know who I am.

116
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:36,601
You're the man who puts me to sleep.

117
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,199
We both can use some sleep.

118
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,581
No go!
No Go!

119
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,678
What are you doing to me?

120
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:47,703
Charles.

121
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:50,095
Come on.

122
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,047
How long have I been here?

123
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:56,875
What are these?

124
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,900
You remember what they are.

125
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:01,775
Shocks and all the seizures.
The pills keep those from happening.

126
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,163
How 'bout you blow on them
to make you safe.

127
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:07,640
Fuck off, Logan.

128
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,192
So, you remember who I am now.

129
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,591
I always know who you are.

130
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,231
But sometimes I don't recognize you.

131
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:16,499
Take the pills.

132
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,867
You leave me alone with
that fucking albino.

133
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:26,849
He doesn't listen to me.

134
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:30,297
I know a damn speciation when I see one.

135
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:30,909
What?

136
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:34,485
Speciation, a new mutant, a young one.

137
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,264
- There are forces trying to kill them.
- Forces?

138
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:38,526
They want help.

139
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,939
Forces, forces.

140
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:43,535
Too bad you are not in that
business anymore.

141
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:47,168
They don't want me,
they want you.

142
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,972
Oh yeah...
That's how fucking stupid they are.

143
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:55,767
They're waiting for you at the
Statue Of Liberty.

144
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,666
Statue of Liberty was a long time ago,
Charles. A long time.

145
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,496
There are no new mutants.
You understand?

146
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:05,842
There hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.

147
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:07,612
We always thought...

148
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,434
We were part of God's plan.

149
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,348
Maybe...

150
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,838
May be we were God's mistake.

151
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:31,629
What a disappointment you are

152
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:35,271
When I found you...

153
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:39,629
You were persuing your career
as a cage fighter.

154
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:43,035
A life of an assassin

155
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:45,381
hooked on barbiturates.

156
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,942
You were an animal.

157
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,461
But we took you in.

158
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,437
I gave you a family.

159
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:55,883
They are gone now.

160
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:57,428
Logan.

161
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,541
Logan...

162
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,121
What did you do?

163
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:06,416
What did you do?

164
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,206
Answer me! Why are we here?

165
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:10,864
No one should live like this.

166
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:12,534
Drugged in a fucking tank!

167
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:15,364
- It's for your own good.
- No no, it's not!

168
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,535
You're waiting for me to die.

169
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:03,275
I don't want to fight...

170
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:06,135
but there's things we need to discuss.

171
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:08,558
What things?

172
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,701
Would it be considered nagging?

173
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:15,340
If I was to repeat my previous observation

174
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,775
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures

175
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:21,749
It's what the guy gave me.

176
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,217
He was not in a position to make demands.

177
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:25,742
Well, I was dying this morning.

178
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,404
- That seizure...
- It was barely a minute.

179
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:29,612
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I could not breathe.

180
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:31,036
You are less affected.

181
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:32,846
You know he needs a higher dose.

182
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:35,539
And I know you got
more money squirreled away.

183
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,029
Money to get us out of here.

184
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,129
No, not us. You and him.

185
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:40,993
You're saving to buy a sun seeker.

186
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:42,445
Sun is the key word.

187
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:46,050
I hardly see myself cowering
below deck it's like Nosferatu

188
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,069
Do you?

189
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:50,985
Folding your underpants,
And making him spotted dick

190
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:56,413
Found this in your pocket.

191
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:59,250
Adamantium.

192
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:02,744
If you're planning to
blow your brains out...

193
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,550
Could you wait till we're out
on the high seas?

194
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,401
- I just mopped these floors.
- I don't need this shit.

195
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:20,176
A year ago, you asked me to help you.

196
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:23,308
God knows I've tried.

197
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,080
But I can't help you, Logan, not really...

198
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:29,660
if you are not gonna talk to me.

199
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:33,419
I hear you at night.
You are not sleeping

200
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,260
You don't wanna talk about that.

201
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,076
Or the booze you're drinking.

202
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,461
Or the pus you are
wiping away from your knuckles.

203
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:45,279
Or the blood I wash in your clothes

204
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,914
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.

205
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:50,194
The ones that aren't healing.

206
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:51,905
And I'm pretty sure..

207
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:55,050
You don't want to talk about the fact that
you can't read the label on that bottle.

208
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:57,904
It says ibuprofen.

209
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:01,101
That was my favorite mug

210
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:03,464
Stay out of my shit.

211
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:07,272
Something is happening to you, Logan.

212
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,894
On the inside you're sick. I can smell it.

213
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,782
<i>Best night ever!</i>

214
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,290
<i>Hey, driver.</i>

215
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:41,778
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

216
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,646
<i>You are such a doll.</i>

217
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,066
Mr. Logan.

218
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,139
Jesus.

219
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:45,142
Please. We need a ride.

220
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:46,934
I am not available. Call a cab.

221
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:49,121
- My name is Gabriella Lopez.
- I don't wanna know your name lady.

222
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,063
there are Men after us.

223
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:52,252
We need to get out of here.

224
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:54,434
Go north, cross to Canada.

225
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:55,829
Anyone can do that job.

226
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:57,745
I'll give you $ 50,000.

227
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:01,060
How did you find me huh?
You are fucking up my life lady.

228
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,653
The people after you,
they are on my ass now.

229
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,606
Sightings were posted.

230
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:08,160
- Lauda, go inside.
- What sightings?

231
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:12,064
People said someone look like the wolverine
was seen at Paso driving.

232
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,783
said he looked old.

233
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,260
Hey!

234
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,171
I told you to stop it with that ball.

235
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,196
- Bad girl.
- No, no, no please!

236
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:23,026
- I told you, bad girl!
- No Please.

237
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,577
- gonna have to pay for that.
- Stop Please.

238
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:29,174
Shit!

239
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,362
They gonna have to pay for damages.

240
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:35,549
And she has cash.

241
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:36,847
I've seen it.

242
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:38,709
You get your fat ass back in your office.

243
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:39,734
She will get your money.

244
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:44,747
Don't let her call anyone. Please.

245
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:46,713
They'll find us, they'll kill us.

246
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:56,411
I'm a nurse.

247
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:59,814
Was, In Mexico City.

248
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:02,511
When did that happen?

249
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:06,239
This morning. Near the border.

250
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:11,380
I got away from them, but...

251
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,454
Now they know my car.

252
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,433
Look, I gotta go.

253
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,542
No wait, wait. Please. Here.

254

257
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:33,481
You are gonna have $ 30,000 more
when we get there.

258
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,561
My friends,

259
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:38,623
They will be waiting.

260
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:40,996
They will give you anything.

261
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:43,404
Where did you get this?

262
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:44,796
My boyfriend.

263
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:48,752
He wants to kill me and take her.

264
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,056
That's your daughter?

265
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Yes.

266
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,332
I know you're still good inside.

267
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:03,533
I know you want to help us.

268
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,745
- You don't know anything about me.
- Please!

269
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,932
I promise, there will be no problems
if we leave now.

270
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:10,876
I can't just leave to North Dakota!

271
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:13,075
- We have to be there Friday.
- For what?

272
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:15,283
Or we miss our chance to cross.

273
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:17,317
Please.

274
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,434
You have to. Please.

275
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:23,813
Please.

276
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,883
I like Rose.

277
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:34,498
They make you look younger.

278
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,584
<i>- Please hurry.
- I'm coming.</i>

279
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,881
Charles, listen. I gotta go uh,

280
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:43,660
I gotta go away for a few days. Okay?

281
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:46,183
I got a long ride, get some good money

282
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,285
When I get back, we gonna get out of here.

283
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,915
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.

284
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,688
And we gonna go live on the ocean.

285
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,990
Will you be safe there?

286
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,298
Yeah, we'll be safe.

287
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,993
Know what Logan got us Charles?

288
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:09,697
I will be back in a few days.

289
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:53,860
Shit.

290
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,608
- Logan.
- Yeah?

291
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:28,157
What happened?

292
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:29,563
Did something go wrong?

293
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,715
Job was wrong
when I get there.

294
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:52,723
Logan!

295
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:57,064
Logan!

296
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:58,412
What?

297
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,497
Who does this belong to?

298
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,727
Who is that?

299
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,572
Guess we are Supposed to see shit coming.

300
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:16,935
I can track mutants.

301
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:19,357
I'm a glorified truffle pig
not a clairvoyant.

302
00:27:19,357 --> 00:27:22,331
Go inside, Keep Charles quiet.
Go inside Now!

303
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,579
You need to turn around, assholes.
This is private property.

304
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:36,185
Yes it is.

305
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:40,085
In fact, I believe it belongs to a
Multinational Smelting company...

306
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:41,700
based in Shanghai.

307
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,437
Where are you keeping the old man?

308
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,013
Is it over there?

309
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,953
Or is he there?

310
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:53,369
That would be smart.

311
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,040
I would like to meet him.

312
00:27:57,423 --> 00:28:02,083
I'm told agency classifies his brain as
a weapon of mass destruction.

313
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:04,832
Damn shame what happened back in east.

314
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,069
He's been dead for years.

315
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
I need the girl.

316
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:11,779
What girl?

317
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:14,141
One that goes along with
that ball you're holding.

318
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:16,208
There is no girl here.

319
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,035
I know you went to the motel.

320
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:19,450
Yeah, I was called there.

321
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,323
There was no girl. there was Just a woman.

322
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:23,956
Just a woman. Such as she was.

323
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,335
So you saw Gabriela.

324
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:32,847
But you did not call me.
That hurts.

325
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:35,921
You didn't shoot the both of them,
did you?

326
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:38,614
- No, did you?
- I asked you first.

327
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:41,293
- I don't like guns.
- Of course.

328
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,582
I wish you would call me Logan.

329
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:45,680
Like I asked.

330
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,234
See?

331
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:52,773
You are not the only one
who's been enhanced.

332
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:02,248
Logan.
Logan!

333
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:04,615
This is Laura.

334
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:06,466
Caliban, come!

335
00:29:06,951 --> 00:29:09,269
This the who I've been telling you about.

336
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:11,178
This is Laura.

337
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:13,656
We've been waiting for you.

338
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:19,822
Come, come here.

339
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:22,138
It's okay.

340
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,861
Come.

341
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:26,385
Laura.

342
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:31,266
It's ok, it's okay.

343
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:34,301
come

344
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:36,153
Come.

345
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:40,744
Come. It's okay.
You can stay here, Laura.

346
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,322
It's safe.

347
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:45,553
Come on.

348
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:50,173
It's like ex military.
Bounty hunter maybe?

349
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:51,198
Worse.

350
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,324
Is he by himself?

351
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,449
Yeah, not for long.

352
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:58,340
Get him back in his ride
take him out to the wash and dump him.

353
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:00,312
And what he wakes up before I get there.

354
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,500
Text me where you are. We will pick you up.

355
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:24,349
Si, si

356
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,161
Logan.

357
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,707
- Logan.
- Hey. Hey!

358
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:34,144
You will get it back after I figure out
what you and your mother have got us into.

359
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:35,574
- No, Logan.
- What?

360
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:37,482
I don't, I think...

361
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,297
Logan, the woman that you met
It's not her mother.

362
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,875
- So she talks?
- We are communicating.

363
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:53,342
Communicating.

364
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:56,548
Take these now.

365
00:30:57,753 --> 00:30:59,816
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

366
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,874
And you can't have an attack out there
you understand?

367
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:06,888
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

368
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:08,718
- She needs our help.
- She's not a mutant.

369
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:11,332
- Yes she is!
- What's her gift, Charles?

370
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:12,856
Eating? pipe Throwing?

371
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:16,587
It's okay.

372
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,047
Oh yeah.

373
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:40,616
"Take the gun. Dump the body".

374
00:31:40,616 --> 00:31:42,764
"Text me when you're on the way back"

375
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:45,884
There is Anything else you need.
Anything for the kid?

376
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:53,789
You're fucked now, muty.

377
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,522
It's ok.

378
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:14,874
It's ok. Sit down.

379
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,361
- We gotta go.
- What?

380
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,016
- What's going on?
- Stay here. Where?

381
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:19,992
- Don't move.
- Where are we going?

382
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,534
Don't worry.
He'll be back for you.

383
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:30,189
Logan, the girl. Don't go.
We gotta go back for the girl.

384
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:37,395
Logan, what about the girl?

385
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:40,592
Logan.

386
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,874
Logan, we mustn't forget about Laura.

387
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:50,274
She's not our problem.

388
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:00,463
Shit!

389
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:10,041
Shit!

390
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:39,582
Logan.

391
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:40,647
Yeah, I'm thinking.

392
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
The child.

393
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,297
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

394
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:45,726
- Please be quite.
- Logan.

395
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,722
- Charles Xavier.
- Where's Caliban?

396
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:55,283
America's most wanted Octogenarian.

397
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,546
I'm not an Nonagenarian, actually.

398
00:34:05,897 --> 00:34:06,897
Where is Caliban?

399
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:10,324
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first.

400
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:12,291
Or I can ask you about.
It seems quite friendly.

401
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:14,179
I told you she's not here.

402
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:16,825
Where is Caliban, motherfucker?

403
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:20,059
I left him in the same ditch
he was gonna leave me.

404
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,642
Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like
this just breaks my damn heart.

405
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:43,070
As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck.

406
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:51,106
Go get her.

407
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:05,296
Laura!

408
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:11,383
Atta girl!

409
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:13,554
Hey baby.

410
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:24,029
Laura...

411
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,353
Laura!

412
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:31,474
Honey, you wanna stay where you are.

413
00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:33,229
You want to see your friends, right?

414
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,205
Commander, just stop.

415
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:38,816
You said alive or dead.

416
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:41,403
Laura!

417
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:43,999
Laura.

418
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:46,639
Laura.

419
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,359
No no.

420
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:51,727
Move!... Go

421
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,478
Move! Now!

422
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,312
Stop shooting.

423
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:07,593
She heals! Move!
Alright move out.

424
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:04,136
As I told you Logan,
She is a mutant like you.

425
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:05,161
Hold on!

426
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,278
Very much like you.

427
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:33,442
Laura, are you alright?

428
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:52,706
Move!

429
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:02,903
Hold on.

430
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:11,434
Fuck!
Oh Come on!

431
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:12,737
Come on!

432
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:21,031
Shit.

433
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:16,024
All in, let's go.

434
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,670
Sit back.

435
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:19,545
Bring me the tracker.

436
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:28,206
You.

437
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,100
Who the hell are you?

438
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:35,651
Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?

439
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:38,226
You know who she is, Logan.

440
00:42:38,537 --> 00:42:39,935
No, I don't

441
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:42,355
Does she remind you of anybody?

442
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:16,519
I read about you when I was a kid.

443
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:20,059
I believe you're thinking of someone else,

444
00:43:28,074 --> 00:43:32,143
Now If I'm not mistaken,
you used to work for my team.

445
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,468
You were helping round up
all those old mutants.

446
00:43:36,578 --> 00:43:37,729
What changed?

447
00:43:39,255 --> 00:43:40,255
You got religion?

448
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:49,008
I'm gonna need you to do one more thing
for the good guys...

449
00:43:49,515 --> 00:43:52,977
and track one more special mutant for me.

450
00:43:57,236 --> 00:43:58,309
I'm not helping you.

451
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:00,624
Of course you would say that.

452
00:44:01,234 --> 00:44:04,007
But I've got a theory that
people don't really change.

453
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:09,057
Beware of the light.

454
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:14,620
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama
told you everyday when you was a kid.

455
00:44:20,252 --> 00:44:22,362
Beware of the light.

456
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:30,935
Let's not bring out the worst in it,
shall we?

457
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,770
The girl is not worth it, trust me.

458
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,918
She is not a natural fuck up, like you.

459
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:38,261
She's a business mistake,
R&D going bad

460
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:39,356
There's liability.

461
00:44:39,356 --> 00:44:42,766
They can't have things with patients
running around hurting people, can they?

462
00:44:43,866 --> 00:44:47,652
We need to get her off the board
before she hurts anybody else.

463
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,198
Someone you care about.

464
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:58,971
So get to sniffing.

465
00:45:03,752 --> 00:45:05,736
<i>My name is Gabriella Lopez.</i>

466
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,280
<i>I'm a nurse.</i>

467
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,640
<i>And for 10 years I worked for
Transigen research in Mexico City.</i>

468
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:15,500
<i>Transigen is owned by an American company.</i>

469
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,329
<i>What I'm about to show you is illegal...</i>

470
00:45:21,824 --> 00:45:23,948
<i>in the US and Canada.</i>

471
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:33,816
<i>They told us we were part of a
pharmaceutical study.</i>

472
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:36,052
<i>But Of course, that was a lie.</i>

473
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:39,425
<i>These children were born in Transigen.</i>

474
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,932
<i>They were born here...</i>

475
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,598
<i>and have never left.</i>

476
00:45:44,598 --> 00:45:46,999
<i>They have never seen the
sun or the ocean...</i>

477
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,311
<i>rain or snow...</i>

478
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,470
<i>or any of God's creatures.</i>

479
00:45:53,582 --> 00:45:55,431
<i>They have no birth certificates...</i>

480
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:57,389
<i>No names...</i>

481
00:45:58,071 --> 00:45:59,551
<i>besides the ones we have given them.</i>

482
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:06,570
<i>They were raised in the
bellies of Mexican Girls.</i>

483
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,593
<i>Cause no one can find anyone.</i>

484
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:12,700
<i>Their fathers were...</i>

485
00:46:12,986 --> 00:46:14,403
<i>Special seeds in bottles.</i>

486
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:30,544
<i>Birthday?</i>

487
00:46:34,077 --> 00:46:36,917
<i>We do not call them baby, or kiss..</i>

488
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:39,806
<i>Do not think them as children.
Think them as students</i>

489
00:46:39,806 --> 00:46:41,485
<i>with patents and copyrights.</i>

490
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:43,986
<i>- Comprende?
- Si seneor.</i>

491
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:47,131
<i>They thought we were too poor
and stupid to understand.</i>

492
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,718
<i>We are poor, yes...</i>

493
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:51,238
<i>but we are not stupid.</i>

494
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:52,382
<i>Use your powers.</i>

495
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:00,413
<i>This is business.</i>

496
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,213
<i>They are making soldiers.</i>

497
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,101
<i>Killers.</i>

498
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,930
<i>These are babies of mutantes...</i>

499
00:47:20,784 --> 00:47:22,085
North Dakota.

500
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:24,700
You took that woman's money.

501
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:27,798
You said you would take the child there.

502
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:34,809
What is she?

503
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:37,715
She is your daughter, Logan.

504
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:41,468
Alkali has your genetic code.

505
00:47:41,468 --> 00:47:43,169
Not just mine.

506
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:43,955
Logan...

507
00:47:43,955 --> 00:47:46,000
I do not want to talk about
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

508
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:47,692
- Logan...
- Just stop.

509
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,730
I have to pee.

510
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:03,884
Last ride.

511
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:09,397
You're welcome.

512
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:18,637
Stop it for God's sake,
I'll do it myself.

513
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:20,984
yeah. But, you're not doing it.

514
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:22,747
Not with you standing there.

515
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:24,549
Trust me, I'm not looking.

516
00:48:58,387 --> 00:48:59,402
Hello!

517
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:01,101
Hi there!

518
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:03,004
You know you got to pay for that, right?

519
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,842
Hey! Where's your Mommy and Daddy huh?

520
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:12,125
Come on.

521
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:13,329
That's enough.. These too.

522
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:16,730
Shit!

523
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:17,995
Not okay!

524
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:22,184
I am sorry.

525
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:25,605
Cell phone chargers?

526
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:33,477
Come on. In the car.

527
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:01,759
<i>As the children became older...</i>

528
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:04,414
<i>Laura. Laura.</i>

529
00:50:04,414 --> 00:50:06,226
<i>They became more difficult.</i>

530
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,297
<i>They were not to be controlled.</i>

531
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:16,298
<i>The company made their bodies into weapons.</i>

532
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,982
<i>They tried to teach them to kill.</i>

533
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,584
<i>But they do not want to fight.</i>

534
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:27,663
<i>A soldier who'll not fight is useless.</i>

535
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,068
<i>Inside this building...</i>

536
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:32,413
<i>They are working on something new.</i>

537
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:36,208
<i>Something they think is better
than the children.</i>

538
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,536
<i>Something They say is without a soul.</i>

539
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:48,768
<i>They must have been successful.</i>

540
00:50:49,532 --> 00:50:53,399
<i>About a week ago, they told us
to shut our programme down.</i>

541
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:03,863
<i>We want to save as many children as we can.</i>

542
00:51:04,238 --> 00:51:06,551
<i>I read about a place up North.</i>

543
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:08,292
<i>A place for mutants.</i>

544
00:51:08,613 --> 00:51:09,718
<i>They call it Eden.</i>

545
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,276
<i>If you're watching this...</i>

546
00:51:26,515 --> 00:51:28,251
<i>It means that I'm dead.</i>

547
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:32,602
<i>I am not sure
if any other children survived.</i>

548
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:35,049
<i>We were separated.</i>

549
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:37,302
<i>There is no more money.</i>

550
00:51:37,581 --> 00:51:39,157
<i>That was a lie.</i>

551
00:51:40,658 --> 00:51:42,339
<i>She's not my child</i>

552
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,081
<i>But I love her.</i>

553
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:48,735
<i>You may not love her.</i>

554
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:52,768
<i>But she's your child.</i>

555
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:56,432
<i>Please. I beg you...</i>

556
00:51:56,685 --> 00:51:58,820
<i>take her to safety.</i>

557
00:52:45,894 --> 00:52:48,069
So it's where we're hiding out?

558
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:49,798
Just hiding out.

559
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:52,087
We'll get a couple of hours sleep...

560
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:55,747
Clean up, get some new clothes,
get a new ride, get out of here.

561
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:04,326
<i>Harrah's Hotel and Casino
welcomes you to Oklahoma City.</i>

562
00:53:08,445 --> 00:53:09,201
Hey.

563
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:10,935
<i>Endless fun at Harrah's Hotel & Casino.</i>

564
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:13,404
Hey, leave it out front, alright?

565
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:21,286
Come on let's go.

566
00:53:48,147 --> 00:53:49,147
Hey, Laura.

567
00:53:49,462 --> 00:53:50,462
Let's go.

568
00:53:50,462 --> 00:53:51,612
We need clothes.

569
00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:05,509
<i>Going up.</i>

570
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:09,600
No, no, stop.
These are not toy.

571
00:54:09,987 --> 00:54:13,291
- No, no, sorry. The chair.
- What? okay.

572
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:15,769
Thank you.

573
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:18,533
Come here. Stay there. Stand there.

574
00:54:19,811 --> 00:54:21,876
Logan, it is yours.

575
00:54:21,876 --> 00:54:22,736
What?

576
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:24,844
Nothing to worry now.
We just need the room.

577
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:42,364
This is a very famous picture, Laura.

578
00:54:42,577 --> 00:54:44,251
It's almost a 100 years old.

579
00:55:18,163 --> 00:55:22,778
I first saw this picture in the Essoldo
cinema in my own town...

580
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,105
when I was your age.

581
00:55:25,105 --> 00:55:28,412
<i>You are in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.</i>

582
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:31,883
<i>Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done...</i>

583
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:44,092
Shit.

584
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:41,049
Do you read this in your spare time?

585
00:56:42,575 --> 00:56:44,455
Oh yeah, Charles,
We have ourselves an X man fan.

586
00:56:45,475 --> 00:56:47,226
You do know they are all bullshit right?

587
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:50,297
Maybe a quarter bit happens,
and not like this.

588
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:52,726
In the real world, people die.

589
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:56,225
And I know who self promoting asshole
in a fucking

590
00:56:56,225 --> 00:56:57,479
This is ice cream for Bed wake.

591
00:56:57,479 --> 00:56:58,269
Logan...

592
00:56:58,507 --> 00:56:59,827
Your nurse has been feeding her
some great bullshit.

593
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:02,834
I don't think that Laura needs reminding of
Life's impounds.

594
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:06,342
Didn't you say something about finding
us a new ride?

595
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:10,524
Two more pills in one hour.

596
00:57:10,524 --> 00:57:11,758
Give them to him.

597
00:57:12,523 --> 00:57:13,649
<i>Why, Shane?</i>

598
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:17,000
<i>A man has to be what he is, Joey.</i>

599
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:19,945
<i>Can't break the moulds.</i>

600
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,501
<i>I tried, that didn't work for me.</i>

601
00:57:22,793 --> 00:57:24,997
<i>Joey, there is no like killing...</i>

602
00:57:25,314 --> 00:57:26,967
<i>There is no going back.</i>

603
00:57:27,354 --> 00:57:29,503
<i>Right or wrong it is a brand.</i>

604
00:57:30,035 --> 00:57:31,471
<i>A brand sticks.</i>

605
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,495
<i>Now you run on home to your mother and
tell her everything is alright.</i>

606
00:57:36,734 --> 00:57:39,656
<i>There are no more guns in the valley.</i>

607
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,599
Who are you guys?

608
00:58:02,242 --> 00:58:05,015
More cops?
cause I told the other guys...

609
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:17,471
Get up! In your cage, tracker.

610
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,012
You did your job.

611
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,710
Fellas.

612
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:56,561
Shit.

613
00:58:58,585 --> 00:58:59,851
Knock yourself out.

614
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,210
Tell you what. Eight grand...

615
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,838
I'll have it freshly painted for you,
new tires, mounted, balanced

616
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:07,890
and complete paperwork.

617
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,304
I'll give you ten as it is
if you can forget the paperwork.

618
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:14,440
Well, you still need new tires.
Man, they're bald.

619
00:59:14,811 --> 00:59:15,990
How long will that take?

620
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,014
An hour.

621
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:50,511
Jesus.

622
01:00:03,356 --> 01:00:05,523
Oh you fuckin' kidding me

Sir, you have your keys in it...? Sir!

624
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,850
You have the keys in it?
Sir!

625
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,479
Shit!

627
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:44,848
Shit!

628
01:03:44,848 --> 01:03:46,228
You alright?

629
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:49,525
We gotta get out of here.

630
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:54,325
I am so sorry.

631
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:57,317
I am so sorry.

You didn't do anything.

01:05:29,563 --> 01:05:33,392
You honestly derived no sense of purpose.

657
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:34,433
from what we are doing?

658
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:36,533
Okay, what are we doing?

659
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:40,498
There is a young mutant
sitting in our car.

660
01:05:40,824 --> 01:05:41,427
Yeah.

661
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:44,133
And where we are taking her,
there are others.

662
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:46,071
Does that mean nothing to you?

663
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:48,076
Oh yeah, yeah it means nothing to me.

664
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,999
Especially since nurse Gabriella...

665
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:52,397
made all that eaten shit up off the
fucking comic Books.

666
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:54,285
What are you talking about?

667
01:05:54,285 --> 01:05:56,556
Give those, Take out two pills
and give them to him.

668
01:05:56,556 --> 01:05:58,323
- Logan, Logan.
- Give 'em to him.

669
01:05:58,524 --> 01:05:59,524
Now!

670
01:06:04,913 --> 01:06:05,913
I wanna see it.

671
01:06:58,195 --> 01:07:01,250
Motherfucking auto trucks.

672
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,628
Language Logan.

673
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:04,863
And you're screaming at a machine.

674
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:08,301
Now what? She can gut a man with a fitch
She can't hear a few naughty words.

675
01:07:08,301 --> 01:07:11,148
She can learn to be better.

676
01:07:11,148 --> 01:07:12,844
You mean, better than me?

677
01:07:12,844 --> 01:07:14,639
Actually yes.

678
01:07:16,355 --> 01:07:18,436
And by the way, Laura's foot claws are

679
01:07:18,638 --> 01:07:21,223
the obvious result of her gender.

680
01:07:21,223 --> 01:07:22,647
Is that a fact?

681
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:24,846
In a pride of lions, the females...

682
01:07:24,846 --> 01:07:27,313
is both hunter and care giver.

683
01:07:27,313 --> 01:07:28,294
Good to Know.

684
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,780
She uses her front claws for hunting...

685
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:33,175
And her back claws defensively.

686
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:33,999
Oh yeah?

687
01:07:34,024 --> 01:07:35,489
Thus ensuring their survival.

688
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:43,057
Hey hey!

689
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:13,482
We should help them.

690
01:08:14,676 --> 01:08:16,969
No we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

691
01:08:16,994 --> 01:08:18,712
Someone has come along.

692
01:08:30,655 --> 01:08:33,015
<i>Alert, alert.</i>

693
01:09:15,895 --> 01:09:17,808
Hey, you need a hand?

694
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:20,572
Ready? Go!

695
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,487
Good, got it!

696
01:09:26,682 --> 01:09:27,714
Come on, Let's get home.

697
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:28,908
Laura!

698
01:09:28,908 --> 01:09:30,009
Thanks so much for your help.

699
01:09:30,385 --> 01:09:31,768
- I'm Kathryn.
- James.

700
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,134
He's my son Nate.

701
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:34,474
- Hi.
- Hi.

702
01:09:34,513 --> 01:09:35,638
That's your daughter?

703
01:09:35,663 --> 01:09:38,450
Oh yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad...

704
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:40,201
Chuck.

705
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:41,455
Come on, Laura, let's go.

706
01:09:41,548 --> 01:09:45,055
Well, can we show our appreciation
and treat 3 of you to a decent meal?

707
01:09:45,095 --> 01:09:46,477
We don't live not far from here.

708
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:48,618
- No thanks.
- That would be lovely.

709
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:58,028
My name is Dr. Rice.

710
01:09:58,383 --> 01:10:00,218
But you can call me Xander if you like.

711
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:05,255
My colleague tells me
you have been some of resistant.

712
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:09,326
He believes you've been
dispensing delayed information.

713
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:11,694
To allow your friends
to stay one step ahead.

714
01:10:14,837 --> 01:10:17,276
I'm offering you with possibility
of redemption, Caliban.

715
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:21,399
To protect the world and
in the process, save your friends.

716
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:25,200
The girl is a small price
to pay for that.

717
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,196
Unlike you, she isn't pure.

718
01:10:27,196 --> 01:10:28,845
She was not made by nature.

719
01:10:28,845 --> 01:10:30,620
She's a mistake of my own.

720
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:33,189
I did what I could
and they burned me and beat me.

721
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:35,049
Your colleagues are savages.

722
01:10:35,236 --> 01:10:36,564
I agree.

723
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,726
The Reavers were very ineffective

724
01:10:38,726 --> 01:10:41,838
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.

725
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:44,235
But I still need someone to part
us in the right direction.

726
01:10:44,235 --> 01:10:45,425
No, I can't help you.

727
01:10:45,726 --> 01:10:47,345
Breath, Breath.

728
01:10:47,345 --> 01:10:49,481
What does he have? the old man?

729
01:10:49,481 --> 01:10:51,423
Alzheimers? ALS?

730
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,573
A degenerative brain disease in the
world's most dangerous brain.

731
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:58,471
What a combo.

732
01:11:12,249 --> 01:11:15,373
Thank you God for this food...

733
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:18,008
And for our new friends to have us.

734
01:11:18,033 --> 01:11:19,340
They came to our aid.

735
01:11:19,794 --> 01:11:21,202
- Amen.
- Amen.

736
01:11:21,602 --> 01:11:22,793
Amen, Here you go.

737
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,649
Thank you sir.

738
01:11:42,938 --> 01:11:44,492
Well, there is plenty more if she wants.

739
01:11:44,492 --> 01:11:46,695
She is right. Thank you.

740
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:47,505
This is delicious.

741
01:11:47,621 --> 01:11:49,022
- Thank you.
- So good.

742
01:11:49,131 --> 01:11:50,385
Where are you all headed?

743
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,379
- Oregon.
- Ah. South Dakota.

744
01:11:54,821 --> 01:11:57,579
Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.

745
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:59,136
Vacation?

746
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:00,162
Yes.

747
01:12:00,907 --> 01:12:01,907
Long overdue.

748
01:12:02,594 --> 01:12:03,822
We are city folks.

749
01:12:03,822 --> 01:12:07,237
Always wanted to do take a road trip,
see the country.

750
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:10,016
Meet the people in it.

751
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,367
That sounds lovely.

752
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:14,603
I'm trying to get Will here
to take a vaction for years.

753
01:12:14,603 --> 01:12:16,928
Taking trips in all over the country,
Who is gonna take care of this place?

754
01:12:16,928 --> 01:12:19,219
Exactly. I say let it go.

755
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:20,625
And live off where?

756
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:22,349
The Lord will provide.

757
01:12:22,349 --> 01:12:25,717
I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide
me with a new Thresher.

758
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:27,847
Honestly, I love to travel someday.

759
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:29,778
Then I bet you will.

760
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:32,640
- I can drive by to school.
- Ok, let's not go in that far.

761
01:12:32,704 --> 01:12:34,131
I mean I'll do it.

762
01:12:34,131 --> 01:12:35,460
- No.
- Why not?

763
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,867
- You wanna travel, I wanna travel.
- Son. Son.

764
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:38,551
That sounds.

765
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,154
It's the perfect.

766
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:41,499
Why would you want to do that, Nate?

767
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:45,230
Careful, you're speaking to a man
who ran a school...

768
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:47,830
for a lot of years, right, Charles?

769
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:50,512
Well, that's.
It was a...

770
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:54,277
It was a kind of special needs school

771
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:57,459
That's a good description.

772
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,177
He was there too.

773
01:12:59,177 --> 01:13:01,687
Yeah, I got kicked out a few times.

774
01:13:02,727 --> 01:13:05,702
I wish I could say that you were a good
pupil, but the words would choke me.

775
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:32,455
I mean, I can't thank you enough for this.
It was great.

776
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,032
But we have a long drive ahead...

777
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,040
But you need to rest, don't you?

778
01:13:35,392 --> 01:13:36,949
Yeah, we'll find a motel.

779
01:13:36,949 --> 01:13:39,233
The nearest one is two hours and
it's not even that nice.

780
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:42,530
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs
for your father and daughter...

781
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:44,291
and you can sleep in the
living room on the.

782
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,516
Kathryn, you're very very nice,
But we should be.

783
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,260
We can leave early in the morning.

784
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,467
Break of dawn, does that work?

785
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,317
Ok, why don't we wash off after?

786
01:13:57,317 --> 01:13:58,517
Okay.

787
01:13:58,517 --> 01:13:59,618
Sit down.

788
01:14:03,004 --> 01:14:05,495
Sweetie, you want some dessert?

789
01:14:05,495 --> 01:14:08,841
Two days on the road, only one meal
and hardly any sleep.

790
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:11,113
She is 11 and I'm fucking 90, dammit.

791
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:13,286
There is 101 reasons to keep moving.

792
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:15,449
I'm not a box of avocados, Logan.

793
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,198
stay the night, then what?

794
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:20,828
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.

795
01:14:23,191 --> 01:14:25,468
And then we bought the Sun Seeker.

796
01:14:26,975 --> 01:14:28,256
Take the pills.

797
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:33,738
Shit!

798
01:14:35,306 --> 01:14:36,845
- What's going on?
- Nate!

799
01:14:37,138 --> 01:14:38,997
Fill the tub before we lose pressure.

800
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:40,611
Honey, check the sink.

801
01:14:42,797 --> 01:14:44,290
They are just not doing this legal.

802
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,906
Only money will handle it now.

803
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,786
Can't wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night

804
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:50,365
We have three guests
and a sink full of dishes.

805
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:52,161
Alright. Alright.

806
01:14:53,213 --> 01:14:55,578
The pumping station that supplies us
is Mile and a half.

807
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:57,675
Sometimes it get itself shut off.

808
01:14:57,876 --> 01:14:59,463
- That asshole.
- Hey!

809
01:14:59,463 --> 01:15:00,048
No.

810
01:15:00,348 --> 01:15:02,425
My son is happy to go with you.

811
01:15:02,425 --> 01:15:04,213
No,
that's fine.

812
01:15:04,514 --> 01:15:06,254
The men that do this
sometimes they can be...

813
01:15:06,254 --> 01:15:08,204
- I can go.
- No, you got homework.

814
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:09,803
Okay, I'll go.

815
01:15:09,803 --> 01:15:11,484
Just I need to get my dad settled.

816
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:16,639
Night.

817
01:15:40,278 --> 01:15:41,401
You Want TV?
there is TV here.

818
01:15:41,401 --> 01:15:42,413
No thank you.

819
01:15:42,614 --> 01:15:43,713
Get some rest.

820
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:45,867
You know, Logan?

821
01:15:45,867 --> 01:15:47,917
This is what a life will explain.

822
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:51,323
A home, people love each other.

823
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:52,912
A safe place.

824
01:15:52,912 --> 01:15:55,299
You should take a moment and feel it.

825
01:15:58,408 --> 01:16:00,190
Yeah. It's great.

826
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:02,244
Logan.
Logan!

827
01:16:03,574 --> 01:16:05,748
You still have time.

828
01:16:08,677 --> 01:16:12,760
Charles, the world
is not the same as it was.

829
01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:17,920
We are takin a riskin' around here,
you know that.

830
01:16:18,626 --> 01:16:21,284
And where we're going, Eden...

831
01:16:22,194 --> 01:16:23,525
does not exist.

832
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:26,391
Her nurse got it from a comic book.

833
01:16:28,344 --> 01:16:30,719
You understand?
It's not real.

834
01:16:31,603 --> 01:16:33,520
It is for Laura.

835
01:16:37,276 --> 01:16:39,524
It is for Laura.

836
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:44,372
Get some rest.

837
01:16:47,492 --> 01:16:50,709
Canewood beverage bought everything up
here except for us.

838
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:53,565
When we wouldn't sell,
They tried on their domain

839
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:55,535
They screw with our water.

840
01:16:56,293 --> 01:16:58,809
A couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

841
01:16:59,476 --> 01:17:02,075
So out on the highway.
those trucks?

842
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:05,178
Who knows. Maybe.

843
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:08,461
Okay.

844
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:12,259
They are like dinosaures with that 20
tonns body and tiny little brains.

845
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:15,952
And all tastes like shit too.

846
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:17,472
Why do people eat?

847
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:21,156
The don't.
Drink that. Corn syrup.

848
01:17:21,156 --> 01:17:24,809
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

849
01:17:24,809 --> 01:17:27,922
Used to be a time,
when a bad day was just a bad day.

850
01:17:28,315 --> 01:17:29,368
Mine's still on.

851
01:17:51,455 --> 01:17:54,142
Those are for

852
01:17:55,144 --> 01:17:56,875
These are for barrel racing...

853
01:17:57,902 --> 01:17:59,648
and right here this for poll painting

854
01:17:59,648 --> 01:18:01,699
They are all second and third place.

855
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:05,323
I'm not too good, but my dad makes me.

856
01:18:13,868 --> 01:18:15,721
Do you want to listen?

857
01:18:26,214 --> 01:18:27,214
You like it?

858
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:33,753
you can take it for tonight...

859
01:18:33,753 --> 01:18:37,299
and I'll get it back from you
in the morning.

860
01:18:41,435 --> 01:18:44,296
Seems like we're gonna be here a while.

861
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:22,407
That'll hold it?

862
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:23,551
Yeah.

863
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:25,168
Until next time.

864
01:19:26,276 --> 01:19:27,364
Thanks.

865
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:33,372
Hey, how long your daughter's
been like that?

866
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:34,665
Mute.

867
01:19:35,741 --> 01:19:39,908
Since the beginning.

868
01:19:41,128 --> 01:19:43,863
Hey, In a lot of ways, I envy you.

869
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:47,456
When they get to be Nate's age,
the nonsence that comes out of their mouths

870
01:19:52,969 --> 01:19:54,404
Shit.

871
01:19:58,887 --> 01:19:59,887
Don't worry.

872
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:03,433
Stay here.

873
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,676
Good evening, Mr. Munson.

874
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:13,528
What brings you out this way?

875
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,844
Why don't you ask your boys.

876
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:18,640
Mr. Munson, you understand
you're tresspassing right now, right?

877
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,882
I have a reasoning with the previous owner
of the property.

878
01:20:21,882 --> 01:20:23,080
Bullshit.

879
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,119
Previous being the operative word

880
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:27,582
Who is this?

881
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:31,321
It's the guy telling you to
get back in your nice truck.

882
01:20:31,321 --> 01:20:34,159
Go play to get somewhere else.

883
01:20:38,556 --> 01:20:39,770
Hey, Carl...

884
01:20:40,338 --> 01:20:43,513
Looks like Mr Munson hired some muscle.

885
01:20:43,747 --> 01:20:45,087
So it's that way.

886
01:20:45,087 --> 01:20:46,702
He is a friend of mine.

887
01:20:46,702 --> 01:20:48,529
A friend with big mouth.

888
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:49,864
I hear that a lot.

889
01:20:50,507 --> 01:20:51,947
Then you probably hear this too.

890
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:56,139
More than I like it.

891
01:20:56,139 --> 01:20:57,361
Then you know it really!

892
01:20:58,509 --> 01:21:00,270
On my count to three...

893
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:01,866
and you're gonna start walking away.

894
01:21:01,866 --> 01:21:02,891
I got a right to this water.

895
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,272
- One.
- I have a lawyer now.

896
01:21:04,272 --> 01:21:05,608
Two.

897
01:21:07,673 --> 01:21:08,673
Three.

898
01:21:08,673 --> 01:21:09,698
You alright, boss?

899
01:21:12,806 --> 01:21:14,406
You know the drill.

900
01:21:14,406 --> 01:21:15,652
Get the hell outta here.

901
01:21:15,652 --> 01:21:17,637
Okay, boss?
Fuck off.

902
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:18,907
Go.

903
01:21:35,492 --> 01:21:36,918
You got a training.

904
01:21:36,918 --> 01:21:38,125
Some.

905
01:21:58,517 --> 01:22:00,767
Hey, don't wake her yet.

906
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:03,037
Let her sleep another hour

907
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:09,145
You know, Logan?

908
01:22:11,235 --> 01:22:14,182
This was without a doubt...

909
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:20,069
the most perfect night I've
had in a very long time.

910
01:22:27,975 --> 01:22:29,971
But I don't deserve it.

911
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:38,910
I did something.

912
01:22:41,636 --> 01:22:44,059
Something unspeakable.

913
01:22:50,061 --> 01:22:53,564
I have remembered
what happened in Westchester.

914
01:22:58,209 --> 01:23:01,323
This is not the first
time I've hurt people.

915
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:06,766
Until today, I did not know.

916
01:23:07,789 --> 01:23:09,574
You wouldn't tell me.

917
01:23:12,038 --> 01:23:17,915
So we just, kept from...
running away from.

918
01:23:22,338 --> 01:23:25,998
I think I finally understand you.

919
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:30,668
Logan...

920
01:23:58,376 --> 01:23:59,665
It's fantastic.

921
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:01,295
You said you only needed the girl!

922
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,072
Your friends had every chance,
so did you.

923
01:24:07,151 --> 01:24:08,151
Nate?

924
01:24:12,336 --> 01:24:13,588
Put her down

925
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:23,110
Honey.

926
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:25,108
Stay there, Will!

927
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:30,911
Kathryn!

928
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,630
Kathryn!

929
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:33,965
Kathryn!

930
01:25:04,653 --> 01:25:05,631
Charles!

931
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:19,791
Hold this.

932
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:22,294
Was not me. it Was not me.

933
01:25:25,214 --> 01:25:26,214
Here he comes.

934
01:25:27,112 --> 01:25:29,248
I could pick em up.
Beat him halfway.

935
01:25:29,248 --> 01:25:30,847
No no no. Let him come to us.

936
01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:32,953
We struggled with the X-23s.

937
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:34,162
We seem because they were children...

938
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:35,708
We could raise them without a conscience.

939
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,012
But you can't manage her rage.

940
01:25:38,293 --> 01:25:39,412
You simply design it..

941
01:25:47,864 --> 01:25:50,228
Who the fuck is that?

942
01:25:55,546 --> 01:25:56,716
Will Munson!

943
01:25:59,681 --> 01:26:01,052
Hold on, Charles.

944
01:26:01,837 --> 01:26:03,877
Munson, goddammit, come out here!

945
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:09,223
Munson!

946
01:26:10,817 --> 01:26:12,248
Come out here now!

947
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:14,756
Come out here now, Munson.

948
01:26:14,756 --> 01:26:16,101
There's that asshole.

949
01:26:17,929 --> 01:26:19,124
Oi, asshole.

950
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:22,605
Listen, I'm willing to let bygones
be bygones.

951
01:26:22,882 --> 01:26:24,607
I do not know what Munson's paying you..

952
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:28,059
but Canewood can start you out at Five G.

953
01:26:28,712 --> 01:26:29,712
A week that is.

954
01:26:31,162 --> 01:26:33,081
You better stay where you are pal.

955
01:26:33,408 --> 01:26:35,130
I'm the law out here.

956
01:26:37,016 --> 01:26:38,200
No no no.

957
01:26:39,259 --> 01:26:40,259
What no!

958
01:26:42,789 --> 01:26:44,180
Oh Shit!

959
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,306
Shoot him!

960
01:26:47,133 --> 01:26:48,271
We need to intervene.

961
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,374
Well he only listens to you, Doc.

962
01:26:53,554 --> 01:26:54,554
24!

963
01:26:56,046 --> 01:26:57,046
Get back here!

964
01:26:57,814 --> 01:26:58,960
Stop!
stop Now!

965
01:26:59,398 --> 01:27:01,158
Hold it still
right now tight.

966
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:07,186
- Our boat.
- What?

967
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:14,743
The sun seeker.

968
01:27:31,868 --> 01:27:32,868
No.

969
01:27:34,488 --> 01:27:35,488
Come!

970
01:27:35,488 --> 01:27:36,669
24!

971
01:27:52,368 --> 01:27:53,871
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

972
01:28:01,387 --> 01:28:02,102
Come!

973
01:28:02,102 --> 01:28:03,428
Now!

974
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:05,579
Pick it up.

975
01:28:16,255 --> 01:28:17,355
Beware of the light.

976
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:42,288
What the hell are you?

977
01:31:08,804 --> 01:31:10,175
Sit down.

978
01:31:29,454 --> 01:31:30,708
Hold still.

979
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,382
Hold still.

980
01:32:05,284 --> 01:32:07,152
It's alright, it's alright.

981
01:32:08,207 --> 01:32:10,063
You did fine 24.

982
01:32:10,063 --> 01:32:12,116
You are healing.
Just breathe.

983
01:32:13,551 --> 01:32:16,136
You're a new born, by new measure.

984
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:17,636
Just breathe.

985
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:19,135
Your body has work to do.

986
01:32:19,135 --> 01:32:21,857
Haemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

987
01:32:21,857 --> 01:32:23,128
Stem cell proliferization.

988
01:32:25,293 --> 01:32:27,061
This will help you heal.

989
01:32:27,894 --> 01:32:29,302
Make you stronger.

990
01:33:24,342 --> 01:33:25,642
Well...

991
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,187
Is it all water and...

992
01:33:56,431 --> 01:33:57,732
It's got water.

993
01:34:32,686 --> 01:34:34,794
Fuck. Fuck.

994
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:39,908
Fuck! Fuck!

995
01:34:40,112 --> 01:34:41,113
Fuck!

996
01:34:41,484 --> 01:34:42,484
Shit!

997
01:34:55,098 --> 01:34:57,672
Fuck! Fuck!

998
01:34:58,628 --> 01:34:59,628
Fuck!

999
01:34:59,628 --> 01:35:01,251
Motherfucking...!

1000
01:35:05,732 --> 01:35:06,732
Shit!

1001
01:35:07,503 --> 01:35:09,502
Fuck! Fuck!

1002
01:35:37,773 --> 01:35:39,355
Welcome back.

1003
01:35:40,059 --> 01:35:41,915
I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell

1004
01:35:41,915 --> 01:35:43,849
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

1005
01:35:43,849 --> 01:35:45,540
her daddy's gone.

1006
01:35:51,601 --> 01:35:52,803
I had always hoped...

1007
01:35:53,653 --> 01:35:58,000
that I get the chance to meet someone
like you.

1008
01:35:58,481 --> 01:36:00,117
Guess a few you left.

1009
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:04,579
Nice to meet you too, doctor.

1010
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:06,335
But I gotta get on my way.

1011
01:36:06,335 --> 01:36:07,560
No, do not do that.

1012
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,066
What you need is rest and treatment.

1013
01:36:10,066 --> 01:36:11,967
You need to check yourself in somewhere.

1014
01:36:11,967 --> 01:36:14,177
- I'll be fine.
- No, you're not!

1015
01:36:14,177 --> 01:36:17,517
I know that you're different...

1016
01:36:17,517 --> 01:36:21,085
but that doesn't change the fact that
something inside you is poisoned.

1017
01:36:21,085 --> 01:36:23,339
You got to check youself into a hospital.

1018
01:36:23,339 --> 01:36:25,052
Find out what it is.

1019
01:36:25,554 --> 01:36:26,790
I know what it is.

1020
01:36:27,689 --> 01:36:31,170
Please Mr, if you don't want to go
to a hospital, maybe I can help you.

1021
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:32,424
Maybe I can run some tests.

1022
01:36:32,424 --> 01:36:34,853
Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy.

1023
01:36:34,853 --> 01:36:36,735
You want to save a life?
save your own.

1024
01:36:36,956 --> 01:36:38,073
Forget we were here.

1025
01:36:38,073 --> 01:36:39,253
Let's go.

1026
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:51,550
Hey!

1027
01:36:51,952 --> 01:36:52,952
Hey!

1028
01:37:13,523 --> 01:37:15,981
You can't just take..

1029
01:37:33,871 --> 01:37:36,268
I don't know how you got me here but..

1030
01:37:37,287 --> 01:37:38,968
Thank you.

1031
01:37:38,968 --> 01:37:40,406
Yeah.

1032
01:37:42,366 --> 01:37:43,775
You can talk?

1033
01:37:45,817 --> 01:37:47,085
You can talk?

1034
01:37:48,013 --> 01:37:49,645
What the fuck..?

1035
01:37:49,645 --> 01:37:50,944
Why the fuck...?

1036
01:37:50,944 --> 01:37:54,155
What's all this bullshit
Being for last 2000 fucking miles?

1037
01:37:57,225 --> 01:37:58,791
What? Shut up.

1038
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:00,183
Shut up, Shut the fuck up!

1039
01:38:03,148 --> 01:38:05,283
What? Who is that?

1040
01:38:05,584 --> 01:38:06,637
Who is that?

1041
01:38:12,349 --> 01:38:13,349
North Dakota.

1042
01:38:13,961 --> 01:38:15,199
What?

1043
01:38:17,229 --> 01:38:18,376
Shit, Look...

1044
01:38:21,055 --> 01:38:22,778
This place. Ok?

1045
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:26,298
Your nurse, she read too many stories,
you understand?

1046
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,100
Too many stories!

1047
01:38:31,941 --> 01:38:34,716
I've seen it! I've seen it, okay?

1048
01:38:35,063 --> 01:38:36,183
This all here...

1049
01:38:36,183 --> 01:38:39,468
None of this..no no existo!
Okay, you understand me?

1050
01:38:39,468 --> 01:38:42,119
This Eden does not exist.
No no.

1051
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:44,257
It's a fantasy. You can't see that?

1052
01:38:44,257 --> 01:38:46,548
Those are the names of people
who just made this...

1053
01:38:47,273 --> 01:38:49,096
They made this whole thing up.

1054
01:38:49,498 --> 01:38:50,742
Okay? this whole..

1055
01:38:50,742 --> 01:38:53,812
It happened once, and they just
turned it into a big fucking lie.

1056
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:56,409
All this is. No!

1057
01:38:57,127 --> 01:38:58,210
Fuck.

1058
01:38:59,219 --> 01:39:00,239
No.

1059
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:02,447
I know, I understand.

1060
01:39:02,968 --> 01:39:04,962
This is a long away.

1061
01:39:04,962 --> 01:39:08,426
You understand?
I am not taking you to North Dakota.

1062
01:39:11,775 --> 01:39:14,905
I am fucked up. And I
can not get you there.

1063
01:39:15,107 --> 01:39:18,328
It is a two day drive
And I am not taking...

1064
01:39:18,804 --> 01:39:20,651
Don't fucking hit me!

1065
01:39:21,002 --> 01:39:21,762
Don't hit me!

1066
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,482
Stop saying those names.

1067
01:39:26,746 --> 01:39:28,604
And stop saying those names.

1068
01:39:28,604 --> 01:39:29,655
Stop!

1069
01:39:29,655 --> 01:39:30,956
Stop!

1070
01:39:31,258 --> 01:39:32,508
Fine fine!

1071
01:39:34,696 --> 01:39:37,677
You wanna go in there?
I'll take you there.

1072
01:39:37,677 --> 01:39:39,495
..See for yourself.

1073
01:39:39,796 --> 01:39:42,121
It's got a Fucking fantasy land.

1074
01:39:54,746 --> 01:39:57,411
We understand the importance
of containment, Dr. Rice.

1075
01:39:57,411 --> 01:39:59,883
But You can not leave a war zone behind
like you did in Juarez.

1076
01:39:59,883 --> 01:40:02,452
Try to remind yourself these are
all for killing machines.

1077
01:40:02,452 --> 01:40:04,469
Machines would happily
disembowed your family

1078
01:40:04,469 --> 01:40:05,849
Not all.

1079
01:40:06,609 --> 01:40:09,849
Told you what these assets off board,
Terror life.

1080
01:40:09,849 --> 01:40:11,072
You changing my brief?

1081
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:12,434
No.

1082
01:40:12,434 --> 01:40:13,629
Why then?

1083
01:40:15,641 --> 01:40:16,696
Dissect tissues from this one.

1084
01:40:16,696 --> 01:40:18,888
It's good tracker,
and had a high IQ.

1085
01:40:24,681 --> 01:40:26,042
Here you go.

1086
01:41:02,505 --> 01:41:03,566
Hey.

1087
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,738
Let me drive.

1088
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:17,593
Absolutely not.

1089
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:24,727
Quit looking at me.

1090
01:41:32,057 --> 01:41:33,553
You're dying.

1091
01:41:36,448 --> 01:41:37,832
You want to die.

1092
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:42,307
Charles told me.

1093
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:47,719
What else did he tell you?

1094
01:41:48,076 --> 01:41:49,729
Do not let you.

1095
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,814
Hey Hey hey!

1096
01:42:10,778 --> 01:42:11,796
Rest.

1097
01:44:55,937 --> 01:44:57,460
Keep it steady.

1098
01:44:59,895 --> 01:45:01,469
Swing him toward me.

1099
01:45:07,478 --> 01:45:09,655
Easy.

1100
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:54,770
Hey.

1101
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,320
Where am I?

1102
01:46:06,098 --> 01:46:07,268
Where did you get that?

1103
01:46:07,487 --> 01:46:08,850
Where we came from.

1104
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:11,649
They gave it to us when we were fighting.
It makes you stronger.

1105
01:46:11,649 --> 01:46:13,519
It makes you crazy is what it does.

1106
01:46:13,721 --> 01:46:14,730
It'll kill you.

1107
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:16,965
No, Not if you use it in small doses.

1108
01:46:17,406 --> 01:46:18,692
It's helping you heal.

1109
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:21,461
Where is Laura?

1110
01:46:21,461 --> 01:46:23,605
She is sleeping down there.

1111
01:46:23,605 --> 01:46:25,589
Do You want me to wake her up?

1112
01:46:33,288 --> 01:46:34,487
No.

1113
01:46:55,672 --> 01:46:57,374
You had a nightmare.

1114
01:47:01,157 --> 01:47:02,989
Do you have nightmares?

1115
01:47:08,351 --> 01:47:10,036
People who hurt me.

1116
01:47:12,194 --> 01:47:13,725
Mine are different.

1117
01:47:19,817 --> 01:47:21,201
I hurt people.

1118
01:47:39,055 --> 01:47:40,588
You know what it is?

1119
01:47:42,385 --> 01:47:44,287
It's made of adamantium.

1120
01:47:45,101 --> 01:47:47,403
It's what they put inside of us.

1121
01:47:48,302 --> 01:47:50,017
So it can kill us.

1122
01:47:51,913 --> 01:47:54,176
Probably what's killing me now.

1123
01:47:58,187 --> 01:47:59,859
I got this a long time ago...

1124
01:48:01,269 --> 01:48:04,668
and kept as a reminder
of what I am.

1125
01:48:06,972 --> 01:48:08,948
Now I keep it to...

1126
01:48:20,528 --> 01:48:22,834
I was thinking of shooting myself.

1127
01:48:23,405 --> 01:48:24,885
Like Charles said.

1128
01:48:30,499 --> 01:48:32,329
I have hurt people too.

1129
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:38,441
You gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

1130
01:48:47,935 --> 01:48:49,935
They were bad people.

1131
01:48:53,728 --> 01:48:55,440
All the same.

1132
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:12,497
It's not funny. That's not funny!

1133
01:50:14,009 --> 01:50:15,409
Hey! Hey pal.

1134
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:17,846
How long have I been out?

1135
01:50:19,456 --> 01:50:21,050
How long have I been in that bed?

1136
01:50:21,050 --> 01:50:22,466
Two days.

1137
01:50:23,907 --> 01:50:25,278
Go and tell everyone to get packing.

1138
01:50:25,278 --> 01:50:27,047
You can't do that
You can not just stay here.

1139
01:50:27,047 --> 01:50:29,242
We had to wait.
It was the plan.

1140
01:50:29,242 --> 01:50:31,638
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

1141
01:50:31,638 --> 01:50:34,398
If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you
and they kill you all.

1142
01:50:34,398 --> 01:50:35,557
You need to get out!

1143
01:50:35,557 --> 01:50:37,681
We are leaving tomorrow before dawn.

1144
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:39,731
We gonna cross the border.

1145
01:50:39,981 --> 01:50:41,483
It's a safe heaven

1146
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:43,883
Seeing coordinates?

1147
01:50:44,134 --> 01:50:46,231
Yes, between noon and 5..

1148
01:50:46,432 --> 01:50:48,833
satellites are blind then..

1149
01:50:48,833 --> 01:50:51,326
- Your asylum approved.
- Copy.

1150
01:51:07,334 --> 01:51:09,026
Swing it to your right, Laura.

1151
01:51:12,432 --> 01:51:14,310
A little more. Yes.

1152
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:15,905
You see the Woods?

1153
01:51:19,623 --> 01:51:20,987
That's a 8 mile hike though here.

1154
01:51:22,144 --> 01:51:23,335
You see that pass?

1155
01:51:24,791 --> 01:51:25,937
That's the border.

1156
01:51:27,844 --> 01:51:29,703
That's where we'll be safe.

1157
01:51:36,975 --> 01:51:38,535
Come inside.

1158
01:51:45,335 --> 01:51:46,883
Laura told me
all that you did for her.

1159
01:51:47,378 --> 01:51:49,315
She was lucky to have you.

1160
01:51:51,851 --> 01:51:54,196
Take it. She says it's yours.

1161
01:51:55,653 --> 01:51:58,286
It's why you did it, right?

1162
01:52:00,434 --> 01:52:02,334
yeah, Well...

1163
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:05,994
Look, I do not need it.
You do. okay?

1164
01:52:05,994 --> 01:52:07,677
Suit yourself.

1165
01:52:29,401 --> 01:52:31,151
Your friends they seem nice.

1166
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:32,616
Kind of reminds me of...

1167
01:52:34,204 --> 01:52:35,552
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1168
01:52:38,616 --> 01:52:40,028
You're with your pals. You made it.

1169
01:52:40,895 --> 01:52:42,393
Where will you go?

1170
01:52:46,311 --> 01:52:48,676
Hey, I got you here.
That was all I signed up for.

1171
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:50,831
Even gave back the money.

1172
01:52:50,831 --> 01:52:52,031
Such a nice man.

1173
01:52:52,031 --> 01:52:54,386
Hey, I never asked for this.

1174
01:52:55,045 --> 01:52:56,747
Alright? Charles did not ask for this.

1175
01:52:56,948 --> 01:52:58,850
Caliban never asked for this.

1176
01:52:59,669 --> 01:53:01,693
And they are six feet under the ground.

1177
01:53:02,834 --> 01:53:04,823
I do not know what Charles
put into your head...

1178
01:53:04,823 --> 01:53:07,590
but I'm not whatever it is you think I am.

1179
01:53:09,206 --> 01:53:11,360
I even met you like a week ago.

1180
01:53:12,638 --> 01:53:14,605
You got your Rebecca, your Delilah...

1181
01:53:14,605 --> 01:53:16,524
your blah, blah, or whatever

1182
01:53:16,524 --> 01:53:18,262
Everything you've asked for you've got it.

1183
01:53:21,425 --> 01:53:23,242
And it is better this way.

1184
01:53:24,712 --> 01:53:26,645
Because I suck at this.

1185
01:53:28,245 --> 01:53:31,427
Bad shit happens to people I care about.

1186
01:53:31,427 --> 01:53:33,117
You understand me?

1187
01:53:35,302 --> 01:53:36,704
Then I'll be fine.

1188
01:56:57,673 --> 01:56:58,923
Run, Bobby, run!

1189
01:57:23,126 --> 01:57:24,527
Go! Go!

1190
01:57:25,251 --> 01:57:26,251
Go faster.

1191
01:57:26,251 --> 01:57:28,453
We should reach them before
they get to the border.

1192
01:58:45,186 --> 01:58:46,389
Move out!

1193
01:58:46,389 --> 01:58:47,589
Let's go! Let's go!

1194
01:58:49,458 --> 01:58:50,857
Run! Run!

1195
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:53,693
Run!

1196
01:59:00,224 --> 01:59:01,757
I want you to breath.

1197
01:59:01,757 --> 01:59:03,215
Just a flesh wound baby

1198
01:59:19,421 --> 01:59:20,421
There she is!

1199
01:59:20,843 --> 01:59:21,843
We got her!

1200
01:59:44,222 --> 01:59:46,203
Back off!

1201
01:59:53,089 --> 01:59:54,089
Get behind me!

1202
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:17,464
You took all the medicine.

1203
02:00:19,098 --> 02:00:20,304
It's wearing off.

1204
02:00:46,928 --> 02:00:48,200
Go to your friends.

1205
02:00:49,597 --> 02:00:50,698
Go.

1206
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:53,379
Laura?

1207
02:00:55,244 --> 02:00:56,489
You'll know when.

1208
02:01:08,469 --> 02:01:09,705
9'o clock!

1209
02:01:11,567 --> 02:01:14,361
The green juice is wearing off huh?

1210
02:01:15,022 --> 02:01:17,541
You know,
You just kind of a short height.

1211
02:01:18,145 --> 02:01:19,747
Hard to keep your claws out sometime.

1212
02:01:19,747 --> 02:01:22,045
Waste this dick, Logan!

1213
02:01:22,969 --> 02:01:24,635
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.

1214
02:01:25,133 --> 02:01:27,249
I'm gonna have to tell this
men to fire on these children.

1215
02:01:27,249 --> 02:01:28,849
You don't want that.

1216
02:01:28,849 --> 02:01:31,196
I can see the effect of the serum
wearing off.

1217
02:01:31,196 --> 02:01:34,071
You will not survive for the wounds

1218
02:01:34,356 --> 02:01:35,885
Allow me to introduce myself.

1219
02:01:36,365 --> 02:01:37,368
Zander Rice.

1220
02:01:38,223 --> 02:01:40,494
I believe you knew my father
on the weapon x program.

1221
02:01:40,494 --> 02:01:44,227
Yeah. he's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

1222
02:01:45,322 --> 02:01:46,690
Yes, he was one of them.

1223
02:01:48,127 --> 02:01:49,863
I think I might have killed him.

1224
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:52,268
I think you're right.

1225
02:01:52,268 --> 02:01:53,864
Why don't Show some respect, muty.

1226
02:01:53,864 --> 02:01:55,978
Your'e looking at the man
who wiped up your kind.

1227
02:01:56,479 --> 02:01:58,553
My friend Donald overspends.

1228
02:01:59,474 --> 02:02:02,273
He makes it sound more
Brutal than intended.

1229
02:02:02,273 --> 02:02:05,584
But that was not to end mutant kind...

1230
02:02:05,584 --> 02:02:07,089
but to control it.

1231
02:02:09,382 --> 02:02:12,082
I've realized we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat n drink

1232
02:02:12,082 --> 02:02:14,768
We could use that as part
to perfect ourselves.

1233
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:18,078
To distribute Gene therapy
discreetly through everything..

1234
02:02:18,078 --> 02:02:20,378
from sweet drinks to breakfast cereals.

1235
02:02:20,579 --> 02:02:21,750
And it worked.

1236
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:24,356
Random mutantcy went the way of polio.

1237
02:02:24,557 --> 02:02:25,957
We embarked on our next endeavour

1238
02:02:25,957 --> 02:02:27,692
Grow on mutants on your own.

1239
02:02:27,692 --> 02:02:28,262
precisely.

1240
02:02:28,287 --> 02:02:29,996
These are dangerous times, James.
You can't.

1241
02:02:48,985 --> 02:02:50,308
Show time, boy!

1242
02:03:26,608 --> 02:03:28,482
Get up, boy
Get up, boy!

1243
02:03:33,294 --> 02:03:34,593
He did that. Get up!

1244
02:03:47,966 --> 02:03:49,559
Laura!
No!

1245
02:03:54,682 --> 02:03:55,682
Laura!

1246
02:05:31,872 --> 02:05:32,971
Go!

1247
02:05:34,272 --> 02:05:35,774
Go! Go! Go!

1248
02:05:36,473 --> 02:05:38,904
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1249
02:05:42,456 --> 02:05:44,522
Go!
Go! Go! Go!

1250
02:05:49,021 --> 02:05:50,021
Go go!

1251
02:05:50,581 --> 02:05:51,581
Go go!

1252
02:05:52,357 --> 02:05:53,163
Run!

1253
02:05:53,365 --> 02:05:54,365
No!

1254
02:06:34,307 --> 02:06:35,708
No no.

1255
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:02,259
Take your friends and run

1256
02:07:02,501 --> 02:07:03,693
No.

1257
02:07:04,622 --> 02:07:07,013
They'll keep coming.

1258
02:07:07,214 --> 02:07:09,812
Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.

1259
02:07:14,133 --> 02:07:14,883
Go!

1260
02:07:23,543 --> 02:07:25,563
Don't be what they made you.

1261
02:07:33,722 --> 02:07:36,041
Laura...
Laura...

1262
