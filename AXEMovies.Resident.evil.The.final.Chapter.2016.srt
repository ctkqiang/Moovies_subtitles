1
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,669
<i>They say that history
is written by the victors.</i>

2
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,381
<i>This, then, is the history
of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

3
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,342
<i>formed by crusading scientist
Professor James Marcus.</i>

4
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,763
<i>Marcus had a young daughter, Alicia,</i>

5
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:38,475
<i>afflicted with Progeria,
a progressive, fatal, wasting disease.</i>

6
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:40,727
<i>Progeria caused premature aging.</i>

7
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,021
<i>By the time she was 25,</i>

8
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,565
<i>Alicia would have the body of a 90-year-old.</i>

9
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,234
<i>Marcus was driven to save her,</i>

10
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,695
<i>but the odds seemed impossible.</i>

11
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,782
<i>And even as he worked desperately
to create a cure,</i>

12
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:55,909
<i>the young girl's father
would record his daughter,</i>

13
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,828
<i>her voice, her likeness,</i>

14
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,455
<i>saving her for posterity.</i>

15
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>But then the breakthrough came.</i>

16
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,919
<i>Marcus discovered the T-virus.</i>

17
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:10,298
<i>Once injected, it would detect and repair
damaged cells within the body.</i>

18
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,801
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

19
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,762
<i>The life of Alicia Marcus was saved.</i>

20
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,765
<i>The T-virus had a myriad of applications,</i>

21
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,059
<i>treating 1,000 different diseases.</i>

22
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:24,103
<i>Overnight, it seemed a new era was dawning,</i>

23
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:28,191
<i>a world without the fear of infection,
sickness or decay.</i>

24
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,402
<i>But it was not to be,</i>

25
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:35,114
<i>for the T-virus
had certain unforeseen side effects.</i>

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,960
Sir, sir, over here!

27
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,295
Hey.

28
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,924
He's not breathing.

29
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,829
<i>The first of the undead was born.</i>

30
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,748
<i>The incident was quickly covered up.</i>

31
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,668
<i>In the aftermath,
James Marcus argued furiously</i>

32
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,169
<i>with his business partner,</i>

33
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,380
<i>Dr. Alexander Isaacs.</i>

34
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,883
I don't care how much it costs,
we have to close the program down.

35
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,428
James, we're gonna be ruined.

36
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,221
My mind is made up.

37
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,641
Pity.

38
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,362
Off to bed, Alicia.

39
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,448
Your father and I are just talking.

40
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,618
Go on.

41
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:13,421
<i>Dr. Isaacs became the guardian
of his dead partner's child</i>

42
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,257
<i>and her half of the company.</i>

43
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,385
<i>The corporation that had begun
with such lofty ideals</i>

44
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,056
<i>had been seduced completely
by greed and power.</i>

45
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:29,228
<i>To help him control the now-vast interests
of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

46
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,732
<i>Dr. Isaacs created
a powerful artificial intelligence.</i>

47
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:37,528
<i>Isaacs used the likeness of Alicia Marcus
for the computer's interface.</i>

48
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:42,075
<i>Isaacs called the computer "the Red Queen."</i>

49
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,454
<i>Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City,</i>

50
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,122
<i>there was an outbreak.</i>

51
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,708
<i>A T-virus escaped
from an underground laboratory</i>

52
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,085
<i>called the Hive.</i>

53
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,046
<i>The American government
attempted to contain the outbreak</i>

54
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,714
<i>by detonating a bomb.</i>

55
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,092
<i>It devastated Raccoon City,</i>

56
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,135
<i>but it couldn't stop the airborne infection.</i>

57
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:04,972
<i>The viral outbreak
spread across the world within days.</i>

58
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,101
<i>Humankind was brought to its knees.</i>

59
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:12,730
<i>Finally, the last and best hope
of humanity gathered</i>

60
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,982
<i>and took a last stand in Washington,
D.C.</i>

61
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,319
<i>But we didn't realize
that what we had walked into</i>

62
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,071
was a trap.

63
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,074
My name is Alice, and this is my story.

64
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,868
The end of my story.

65
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:22,920
Come on!

66
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,390
Hello?

67
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,072
Is there anyone alive in here?

68
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,834
Hello?

69
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,698
You come here to gloat?

70
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:47,244
<i>My satellites show
there are 4,472 humans remaining</i>

71
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,247
<i>on the surface of the Earth.
They will cease to exist</i>

72
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,208
<i>in under 48 hours.</i>

73
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,001
What do you want from me?

74
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,295
You want me to say that you've won?

75
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,423
- You've wiped out humanity.
<i>- No. Quite the opposite.</i>

76
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,258
<i>I want you to stop me...</i>

77
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,719
<i>To stop me... Stop... I want you to stop me.</i>

78
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:05,888
<i>Behind you.</i>

79
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,276
<i>Nicely done.</i>

80
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:20,736
I don't trust you.

81
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,614
<i>Given our history, I'd be surprised if you did.</i>

82
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,700
<i>But unless you intervene,
the slaughter will be complete.</i>

83
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,494
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

84
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,371
How can I possibly help them?

85
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,249
<i>Umbrella developed an airborne antivirus.</i>

86
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,503
<i>If released, it would destroy the T-virus</i>

87
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,047
<i>and anything it has infected, on contact.</i>

88
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,258
All this could end?

89
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,550
<i>Precisely.</i>

90
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,177
Where is this antivirus?

91
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,097
<i>Beneath the streets of Raccoon City,
in the Hive.</i>

92
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,848
Why would you help me?

93
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,477
<i>My programming will not allow me
to harm the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

94
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,230
<i>but you are bound by no such constraints.</i>

95
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:00,067
You'd turn against Umbrella,
against the people who created you?

96
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,652
Why?

97
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,613
<i>Get to Raccoon City in 48 hours,</i>

98
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:07,616
<i>make it to the Hive,
and then you'll have your answer.</i>

99
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,494
I have no reason to believe a word you say.

100
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,914
<i>True. But I can offer you
something you want very much.</i>

101
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,374
What is that?

102
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,542
<i>Revenge.</i>

103
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,043
<i>Wesker.</i>

104
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,713
<i>He led you all here to Washington.</i>

105
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,257
<i>He pretended to give you your powers back,</i>

106
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,551
<i>and then he betrayed you.</i>

107
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,012
Where is he?

108
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,888
<i>He just landed at the Hive.</i>

109
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,849
<i>I'm resetting your watch.</i>

110
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,812
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

111
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,399
<i>Alice.</i>

112
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,903
<i>Ten years ago in the Hive, we both failed.</i>

113
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,363
<i>We let this happen.</i>

114
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,907
<i>Make it right.</i>

115
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,340
Is that all you got?

116
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,607
<i>Alice.</i>

117
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,112
<i>Ten years ago in the Hive...</i>

118
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,822
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

119
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,407
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

120
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,172
What is this place?

121
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,509
Where am I? Answer me.

122
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,553
- What's wrong with you?
- Be quiet.

123
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,390
- Who did this?
- Quiet! I told you.

124
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,483
Silence.

125
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,242
So, you're awake at last.

126
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,536
I killed you.

127
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,539
- Yet here I am.
- A clone.

128
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,083
I killed your clone.

129
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,544
You've been most troublesome to me.

130
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,005
You and your sisters.

131
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:19,803
And now I have you.

132
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,851
The cleansing operation
should have finished over a year ago,

133
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,311
but you slowed us down.

134
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,189
So much so that I was obliged
to take command myself.

135
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,816
You could end all of this.

136
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,777
Why don't you?

137
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,321
Interesting.

138
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,950
Someone told you something, didn't they?

139
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,249
Well, you will be begging
to tell me soon enough.

140
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,295
She's an unbeliever.

141
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,590
What do we do with unbelievers?

142
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,925
Cast her out.

143
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,428
Cast her out.

144
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:05,515
Cast her out! Cast her out!

145
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,601
- Come on!
- Cast her out!

146
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,771
Cast her out! Cast her out!

147
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:15,317
Cast her out! Cast her out!
Cast her out! Cast her out!

148
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,241
The Lord created a flood
to cleanse the Earth.

149
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,120
40 days and 40 nights of rain.

150
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,706
Our method has taken a little longer,
but the result will be the same.

151
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,877
A world ready for the righteous
and the pure to inherit.

152
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:24,344
We reach Raccoon City in just over 12 hours.

153
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,765
I doubt even you can run for that long.

154
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,726
I want to know what you know.

155
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,605
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

156
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,326
<i>- Wesker.</i>
- Dr. Isaacs.

157
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,329
<i>Look what I found on the roadside.</i>

158
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,625
<i>It would appear your mission to Washington</i>

159
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,252
<i>was less successful than you made out.</i>

160
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,421
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- I hope you didn't leave

161
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,755
any other loose ends.

162
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,508
There's something else.

163
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,637
I think she knows
about the airborne antivirus.

164
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,515
<i>- How can that be?</i>
- I don't know yet.

165
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,518
But we caught her
on the road to Raccoon City.

166
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,729
<i>Why else would she be headed there?</i>

167
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,857
Raise the security level
at the Hive to maximum.

168
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,400
No one in or out.

169
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,235
I'll let you know when she talks.

170
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,987
God go with you.

171
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:26,907
You heard him.

172
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,450
Security level to maximum.

173
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,910
<i>As you wish.</i>

174
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,729
Get up there and check it out.

175
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,518
Release me!

176
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,522
- Open them.
- All right. All right.

177
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,899
You can't use it. You can't escape.

178
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,917
Move!

179
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,441
Jesus.

180
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:30,984
Jesus.

181
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,194
Jesus.

182
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,241
Sir.

183
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,410
She's gone.

184
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:42,996
I won't forgive her.

185
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,476
<i>Target is 72 miles and closing.</i>

186
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,854
Lock down the Hive,
prepare defensive measures,

187
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,440
and alert our operative in Raccoon City.

188
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,225
Welcome home.

189
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,971
<i>...an airborne antivirus...</i>

190
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,473
<i>...under 48 hours...</i>

191
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,142
<i>Make... Make... Make it to the Hive.</i>

192
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,153
Let him go! Let him go now!

193
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,697
Put it down or we'll shoot!

194
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,366
I told you, Doc!

195
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,618
- Calm down, Christian!
- I told you you were wrong!

196
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:46,995
- Calm down.
- We should have killed her

197
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,205
- when we had the chance!
- Put it down, please,

198
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,000
- before he tries to shoot the both of us.
- What's in this?

199
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,961
- Pure adrenaline. I needed you awake.
- Why?

200
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,421
There's something coming,

201
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,214
in the same direction you came,
something big.

202
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,842
Let him go! Put it down. Now.

203
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,846
Alice?

204
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,272
Umbrella captured me at the Arcadia.

205
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,274
We were headed somewhere called the Hive.

206
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,276
Got loose, killed the pilot, crashed here.

207
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,404
Doc and the others pulled me from the crash.

208
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,948
- I owe them my life.
- Doc!

209
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,201
There, to the east.

210
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:28,745
Still headed our way.

211
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,623
You know what it is?

212
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,126
Umbrella. Dr. Isaacs.

213
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,461
I thought that you killed him.

214
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,796
I thought so, too.

215
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,965
He has an army of undead with him.

216
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,717
They'll be here within hours.

217
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,427
What do we do?

218
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:45,887
Why the hell are we asking her?

219
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,264
She's a stranger. We shouldn't trust her.

220
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,266
- Listen to me, Claire.
- Hey, hey, hey, Christian!

221
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,226
- Don't you touch me, Doc!
- Put it down!

222
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,354
- You put it down! You put it down!
- Christian! Hey!

223
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,688
Hey. Look at me.

224
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,232
Just 'cause you think
you should be in charge doesn't make it so.

225
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,317
Just... Hey.

226
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,740
You listen to me, Doc. You're gonna regret it.

227
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:07,450
All of you!

228
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,370
All of you!

229
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,716
I have to get to the Hive.

230
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,636
You have to get these people out of here.

231
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,305
We have children, injured, the elderly.

232
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,599
You know, what chance
do they have on the open road?

233
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:32,684
Better than they have here.

234
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,186
- This building is secure.
- Maybe from the undead,

235
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,897
but Isaacs has armored vehicles,

236
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,358
rocket launchers, heavy ordnance.

237
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,819
They're gonna tear this place wide open.

238
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,281
- Doc!
- Okay, okay.

239
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,375
So, what happened to her?

240
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,253
She was hit by one of the traps
on the outer perimeter.

241
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,754
They were intended for the undead.

242
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,344
- What is this?
- Specialty of the house.

243
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,013
Have you on your feet in no time.

244
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,389
Why should I trust you?

245
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,312
Here.

246
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,487
Doc, we need to get out of here.

247
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,698
People are scared,
and Christian's not helping.

248
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,284
You need to let people know
what's happening.

249
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,535
Okay.

250
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,371
I've got to go.

251
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,249
Hey.

252
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,584
Your friend's gonna be okay.

253
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,086
Thank you.

254
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,886
- You know, he and I...
- I noticed.

255
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,430
So, what's in the Hive?

256
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,183
Umbrella developed a cure,

257
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,643
an airborne antivirus.

258
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,647
It'll destroy anything infected
with the T-virus on contact.

259
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,191
Who told you this?

260
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,443
- The Red Queen.
- And you believed her?

261
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,113
- What if we can end all this?
- What about you?

262
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,324
They infected you with the T-virus.

263
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,869
You release this antivirus,
it's going to kill you.

264
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,205
- Whatever it takes.
- Alice, I'm not...

265
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,623
You know I'm right.

266
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,503
All right.

267
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:29,133
We stop Isaacs here, we save these people,

268
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,094
and then we go together.

269
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,764
We don't have long.

270
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:38,351
Let's get to it.

271
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,201
What else do you have for defense?

272
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:58,287
Not too many firearms,
but we have a big supply of gasoline.

273
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,540
Here, you need a weapon.

274
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:03,501
- We're giving her a gun now?
- Take it easy, Christian.

275
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,294
You can let your guard down
if you want, man.

276
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,546
I don't intend to.

277
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,593
When I rode in here,
someone was watching me.

278
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,679
They could have called out or fired a shot

279
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,556
to warn me about the trap, but they didn't.

280
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,224
What are you saying?

281
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,269
Watch your back.

282
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,865
<i>So, Dr. Isaacs,</i>

283
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,033
it seems you let her
slip through your fingers.

284
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,285
<i>Or what remains of them.</i>

285
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:38,995
Don't forget who you're talking to.

286
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:40,955
Where is she?

287
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,206
<i>The settlement in Raccoon City.</i>

288
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,334
<i>Our informant reports
that she's preparing for a fight.</i>

289
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,627
Good.

290
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,671
I'll be there in the hour.

291
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,114
That's it, keep moving!

292
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,868
We need all the gasoline cans over there.

293
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,915
- Over here!
- On my way!

294
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,500
- Claire said you built this.
- Yeah, that's right.

295
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,462
This used to be a window washer.

296
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,008
- I made a couple of changes.
- Where'd you learn to do that?

297
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:37,094
My father used to run a chop shop. I hated it.

298
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:40,264
Who knew?
I guess I was paying attention after all.

299
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:43,392
Good, because I'm gonna need you
to make a few more changes

300
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:44,852
to this thing.

301
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,793
Ready the weapons.

302
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,378
High-explosive rounds.

303
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,421
No survivors.

304
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,435
He's here.

305
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,312
They're coming!

306
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,523
Close the gates!

307
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,916
My God.

308
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,085
It's an army.

309
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:58,551
What are we gonna do?

310
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,052
Yeah.

311
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,596
What are we gonna do?

312
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,516
We're gonna kill every last one of them.

313
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,988
Prepare to fire!

314
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,586
Get ready.

315
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,506
- Light her up!
- Up top.

316
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,686
- Fire!
- Fire!

317
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,910
- Damn her.
- Reload.

318
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,664
Close it up. Full stop.

319
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,418
Release the bait.

320
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:20,674
There's a survivor.

321
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,593
- Open the gate.
- Open the gate!

322
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,721
Open fire!

323
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,515
Keep them off her.

324
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,811
Marker two.

325
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,191
- Fire!
- Fire!

326
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,286
Claire, Doc, get out there. Bring her in.

327
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,795
Come on.

328
00:38:58,879 --> 00:38:59,922
Wait.

329
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,133
She's almost there.

330
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,511
Fire.

331
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:08,806
Damn you.

332
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,391
Close the gate now.

333
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,027
Claire, they've breached the gate.

334
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:30,536
Claire!

335
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,296
Fire.

336
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,305
Razor, now!

337
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:50,890
Right! You heard her!

338
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:52,683
Now, push!

339
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,401
Move!

340
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:15,122
Abandon the gate.
Pull back to the barricades.

341
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,082
Looks like she's out of tricks.

342
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,001
Target the roof.

343
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:22,379
Everybody get down!

344
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:25,424
Now!

345
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:52,993
Alice, we're at the barricades.

346
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,662
Claire, you have to hold them there.

347
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,648
Come on!

348
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,365
Doc!

349
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,808
- Alice, we can't hold on much longer.
- Get out of there now.

350
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:40,351
Back up.

351
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:41,727
Now!

352
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:04,625
Bring all guns to bear.

353
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:10,839
Fire.

354
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,095
Where is she?

355
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,056
Where did she go?

356
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:22,559
Find her.

357
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,652
Close the vents now!

358
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,166
Don't shoot.

359
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,343
You're fast.

360
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:40,387
But you're not too smart.

361
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:15,839
No. Don't shoot, please.

362
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:17,841
- Where is he?
- That way.

363
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:32,397
- Save your ammo.
- There's too many of these things

364
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:33,732
still out here.

365
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,108
I'll take care of it.

366
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,029
No.

367
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:41,990
Move out.

368
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:43,784
Let's go!

369
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,744
Enjoy the ride.

370
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,515
<i>- Guys?</i>
- Go.

371
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,975
<i>There's something here you gotta see.</i>

372
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:12,062
Two more armies of undead
headed straight for us.

373
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,273
There, on the horizon.

374
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,193
And a second over there.

375
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,906
We're out of gasoline. We're defenseless.

376
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,909
We have to make it to the Hive.

377
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,453
- It's our only chance now.
- I'm coming with you.

378
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:30,372
- Count me in.
- Me, too.

379
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:31,957
And me.

380
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,668
So I was wrong about you. Blow me.

381
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:44,136
We know where you're going.

382
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:45,929
Into the pit.

383
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:48,056
We wanna come.

384
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,101
Please.

385
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:53,562
Grab some gear.

386
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:55,439
You're gonna need it.

387
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:17,711
- There.
- What is it?

388
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,755
The part of the Hive exposed by the blast.

389
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:21,340
That's our way in.

390
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:41,818
Let's move!

391
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:43,028
I'll take point.

392
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,261
Activate security measures now.

393
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:11,723
<i>Hive security fully activated and automated.</i>

394
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:14,434
No. Disengage automation.

395
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:16,770
I'll handle the defenses myself.

396
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:18,563
<i>The defenses would be more efficient</i>

397
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:20,649
<i>if I retained control of them.</i>

398
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,276
Really?

399
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:26,405
I seem to remember last time she was here,
she walked out alive.

400
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:29,491
I don't intend to make that same mistake.

401
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,703
<i>As you wish.
Hive defenses are now in your hands.</i>

402
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:36,540
Unleash the Cerberus.

403
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:39,793
<i>Cerberus are in play...
Are in play... Are in play...</i>

404
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:46,174
You have someone before all this?

405
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,885
Husband? Family?

406
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:51,471
I can't remember.

407
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,015
How is that possible?

408
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,891
I woke up just when all this was starting.

409
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,602
I can't recall much before that.

410
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,564
Sometimes I feel like
this has been my whole life.

411
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:01,898
Running,

412
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:03,900
killing.

413
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:16,830
What is it?

414
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:18,457
Something's stalking us.

415
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,250
Are you sure?

416
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:22,335
This is what I do.

417
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:37,267
Run.

418
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,144
Run fast!

419
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:02,102
Come on!

420
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,412
Is everyone okay?

421
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:25,917
It's this way!

422
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,226
Right behind us!

423
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:12,881
Why did they stop?

424
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:16,968
Maybe they're scared.

425
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,136
Scared of what?

426
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:22,307
Whatever's down there.

427
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:31,441
Seal the Hive.

428
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:38,073
Let's go.

429
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:48,959
Alice!

430
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:22,659
Hey. You okay?

431
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:23,994
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

432
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:27,038
- My mag's half empty.
- Lost my guns at the lake.

433
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:29,165
I only got one round left.

434
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:32,585
- One spare mag, and then I'm out.
- No guns, no ammo.

435
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:35,130
What the hell are we gonna do down here?

436
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,342
Alice, what's with the lights?

437
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,344
This part of the Hive is damaged.

438
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,472
- The power's erratic.
- Here, take this.

439
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:47,767
Hey. Look.

440
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,405
<i>You asked
why I would turn against Umbrella,</i>

441
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,282
<i>and I promised you an answer.</i>

442
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:04,617
<i>Soon after the T-virus was released,</i>

443
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:07,787
<i>a secret file was uploaded to my data stream.</i>

444
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:11,499
<i>It was a recording of a meeting
of the Umbrella high command</i>

445
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:15,378
<i>dated 17 months
before the viral outbreak occurred.</i>

446
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,130
<i>We're here today</i>

447
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:20,800
<i>not just to talk about
the future of this company.</i>

448
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:23,470
<i>We're here to talk about its destiny.</i>

449
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,765
We're here to talk about the end of the world.

450
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:30,226
We stand on the brink of Armageddon.

451
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,479
<i>Diseases for which we have no cure.</i>

452
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:36,066
Fundamentalist states
who call for our destruction.

453
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,777
<i>Nuclear powers
over which we have no control.</i>

454
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:42,030
And even if we navigate
these dangerous waters,

455
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,908
we face other, even more inevitable threats.

456
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:49,579
Global warming will melt the polar ice caps
within 80 years,

457
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,415
flooding 90% of all habitable areas on Earth.

458
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,626
Unchecked population growth

459
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:57,128
<i>will overtake food production
in less than 50 years,</i>

460
00:54:57,212 --> 00:54:59,839
leading to famine and war.

461
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:03,093
This is not conjecture. This is fact.

462
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:05,261
One way or another,

463
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,472
our world is coming to an end.

464
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:11,768
Now, the question is, will we end with it?

465
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,687
What do you propose?

466
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,234
I propose that we end the world,

467
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,070
but on our terms.

468
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:25,240
An orchestrated apocalypse,

469
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:28,201
one that will cleanse the Earth
of its population,

470
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:31,579
but leave its infrastructure
and resources intact.

471
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,040
It's been done once before...

472
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,251
...with great success.

473
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:40,004
The chosen few will ride out the storm,

474
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,549
not in an Ark, as in the book of Genesis,

475
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:45,051
but in safety, underground.

476
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,179
And when it's over, we will emerge

477
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:52,392
<i>onto a cleansed Earth,
one that we can then reboot</i>

478
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:54,352
in our image.

479
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,480
And just how do you intend to achieve this?

480
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:00,775
The means of our salvation
are already at hand.

481
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:03,069
I give to you

482
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:05,780
the T-virus.

483
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,951
They released it deliberately.

484
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:13,538
<i>When this recording
was uploaded to my data stream,</i>

485
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:16,332
<i>it created a conflict in my programming.</i>

486
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:19,335
<i>I was created to serve
the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

487
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:22,881
<i>but I was also programmed
to value human life.</i>

488
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:25,466
<i>Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to escape.</i>

489
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:28,636
<i>He murdered over 7 billion people.</i>

490
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:33,892
<i>My programming will not allow me to harm
an employee of the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

491
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:37,896
<i>I am powerless to stop Dr. Isaacs,
but you are not.</i>

492
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:39,480
<i>In 37 minutes,</i>

493
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:42,066
<i>the last of the human settlements will fall.</i>

494
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,735
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

495
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:48,198
<i>It is imperative you release the antivirus
before this occurs,</i>

496
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:50,200
<i>or Umbrella will have won.</i>

497
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:51,910
<i>There is one last thing.</i>

498
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:54,037
<i>There is an earpiece in front of you.</i>

499
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,788
<i>Put it in.</i>

500
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,003
<i>I cannot, through my actions,</i>

501
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,380
<i>harm an employee
of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

502
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:07,467
<i>but I can tell you
that Umbrella had an informant</i>

503
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:09,010
<i>in Raccoon City.</i>

504
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:12,722
<i>It is highly likely that this person
is now here with you.</i>

505
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,809
<i>Time is running out, Alice.</i>

506
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:18,228
<i>You have to hurry.</i>

507
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,307
We're glad to see you, Dr. Isaacs.

508
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:57,976
We didn't think there were any survivors

509
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:00,061
- after the last attack.
- Water.

510
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,355
Yes, of course. Get Dr. Isaacs some water.

511
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:04,357
Then resume course for Raccoon City.

512
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,943
- She's not there.
- What?

513
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,153
She went to the pit. We have to follow.

514
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:12,115
- Those are not my orders.
- We have to go to the pit.

515
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,866
I have strict orders...

516
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:28,423
Thank you.

517
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:46,524
What is this place?

518
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:48,943
It's an air intake for the Hive. Come on!

519
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,030
No. Really?

520
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:40,870
All clear!

521
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,111
Hurry up! The power's coming back on!

522
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:15,071
- Claire!
- Hurry! Let's go!

523
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:26,791
Claire!

524
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,042
Come on!

525
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:30,294
- Come on!
- I can't!

526
01:00:36,843 --> 01:00:37,927
Shit!

527
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,430
Okay.

528
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:44,892
- You all right?
- Yeah.

529
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:50,690
Someone's watching us.

530
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:56,696
Reverse polarity of the turbine.

531
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:12,753
The blades are going the other way.

532
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:14,505
We have to get out of here.

533
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,883
The blades are sucking the air backwards!

534
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:21,012
Come on!

535
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:28,227
Come on!

536
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:44,494
Come on!

537
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,376
Come on.

538
01:02:39,048 --> 01:02:40,049
No!

539
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:41,671
It's this way.

540
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,508
We have to hurry.

541
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:47,802
Wait!

542
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,658
Let's go.

543
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:19,203
Razor?

544
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:21,413
You okay?

545
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,168
Yeah.

546
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:28,170
<i>Let's go.</i>

547
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:01,722
Hey!

548
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:02,848
Hey!

549
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:13,585
It's all right.

550
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:17,881
What the hell is that?

551
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:20,259
Bioweapon. It was once human.

552
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:22,511
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.

553
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,221
<i>Razor?</i>

554
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:26,306
He didn't make it.

555
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:31,270
Come on. We have to hurry.

556
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:35,315
<i>If the target continues on her present course,</i>

557
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:37,484
<i>she'll be here in under seven minutes.</i>

558
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:38,819
Wake them.

559
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:40,863
<i>My instructions are to do so</i>

560
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:43,532
<i>only in the greatest of emergencies.</i>

561
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:46,076
Wake them now.

562
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:56,980
What is it?

563
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,372
We have to get out of here.

564
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,391
Here. More stopping power.

565
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:42,359
Time's running out.

566
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:43,610
Where to next?

567
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:48,657
The final level of the Hive's below us.

568
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,242
How do we get down there?

569
01:12:54,955 --> 01:12:56,206
Like so.

570
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:14,975
What are they?

571
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:16,768
Cryogenic storage.

572
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,105
Must be thousands of them.

573
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:22,190
The Umbrella high command,

574
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:25,736
waiting out the apocalypse in safety.

575
01:13:29,031 --> 01:13:31,491
A Noah's Ark for the rich

576
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:33,201
and powerful.

577
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,123
What are you doing?

578
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:41,919
Give me a hand.

579
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:58,268
Is it done?
The cleansing process is complete?

580
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,021
- No.
- Then why am I awake?

581
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:02,940
We had a problem.

582
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,900
- I tried...
- Save your breath.

583
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:07,569
I know exactly what's happening.

584
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,074
We've been betrayed.

585
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:23,585
That's right!

586
01:14:24,795 --> 01:14:26,380
Over here!

587
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:30,425
Come on! That's it!

588
01:14:31,093 --> 01:14:32,386
Follow me!

589
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:36,033
Let's go.

590
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:53,759
The bad seed returns.

591
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:56,845
Or is it the prodigal daughter?

592
01:15:57,012 --> 01:15:58,847
Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

593
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:03,060
After all, you have only
nine minutes to save the world.

594
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:06,855
- You're really him?
- First things first.

595
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:09,274
I'm gonna need you to place your weapons
on the floor.

596
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,942
Why would I want to do that?

597
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:12,903
This is what you're after, yes?

598
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:15,363
The antivirus.

599
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:17,365
The cure to all this.

600
01:16:19,284 --> 01:16:20,952
Well, there's only one vial.

601
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:24,414
And we're a half a mile underground
in a sealed facility.

602
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:27,334
I drop it here, the antivirus goes nowhere,

603
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,211
and your hopeless dreams

604
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:31,546
will die sooner rather than later.

605
01:16:43,183 --> 01:16:44,726
Good girl.

606
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:50,565
- You're still armed.
- Yes,

607
01:16:51,233 --> 01:16:53,985
- I am.
- Claire would be so disappointed.

608
01:16:54,236 --> 01:16:56,321
In a few minutes, Claire will be dead,

609
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:57,864
along with everybody else you know.

610
01:16:57,948 --> 01:16:59,157
That's sweet.

611
01:17:01,952 --> 01:17:03,120
Sorry.

612
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,412
My love.

613
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,040
Move away from the weapon.

614
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:08,375
And the detonator.

615
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,543
Come on.

616
01:17:12,838 --> 01:17:15,340
She placed explosives
in the high command cryo-tubes.

617
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,591
I'll disarm them.

618
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:19,136
Thank you. You've done well, Doc.

619
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:52,085
Don't bother.

620
01:17:52,419 --> 01:17:53,503
You don't make it

621
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:54,629
to the ice pick,

622
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:56,173
the decanter

623
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:57,841
or the fountain pen.

624
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,872
And in answer to your question, yes,

625
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,374
apart from a few technological upgrades,

626
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:34,586
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

627
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,214
- The original.
- The one I met out there,

628
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:38,798
he thought exactly the same thing.

629
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,092
Well, of course he did.
That's how they're designed.

630
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,678
They always try harder and fight longer,

631
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:44,846
even to the death,

632
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,140
as long as they think they're the real thing.

633
01:18:47,641 --> 01:18:50,435
After all, who wants to know
they're just a poor imitation,

634
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:51,770
a worthless copy?

635
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,522
Which brings us to you.

636
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,192
- No.
- Come now.

637
01:18:58,944 --> 01:19:00,904
You thought you were the original?

638
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,200
How delicious.

639
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:10,455
No, I'm afraid she holds that dubious honor.

640
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,165
Alicia Marcus,

641
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:14,334
daughter of my old partner, James,

642
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:16,503
co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation

643
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:18,546
and a painful thorn in my side.

644
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,882
One I now intend to remove.

645
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,926
Time is running out.

646
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:26,513
Alice, you must kill him soon.

647
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:28,932
It's good to see you, too, Alicia.

648
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:32,686
Marcus created the T-virus to save her,

649
01:19:32,769 --> 01:19:34,271
but the effects didn't last.

650
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:37,399
But I have been waiting years for her to die.

651
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:39,567
I'm not...

652
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:41,444
I'm not a clone.

653
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:42,904
Really?

654
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:44,572
You must have wondered

655
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:46,283
why you remember
nothing of your childhood.

656
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:49,077
Your father, your mother...

657
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,163
Memory loss.

658
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:53,248
No.

659
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:56,126
You have no memory
because you had no life,

660
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:57,919
nothing before the mansion,

661
01:19:58,003 --> 01:20:00,046
when we created you 10 years ago.

662
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:01,881
I know who I am.

663
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,341
I don't think so.

664
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,720
You're nothing more than a puppet
whose strings were cut

665
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,264
and then you wandered around
for a little while

666
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:11,349
thinking you were a real girl, but you're not.

667
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:15,437
You're just a clever imitation, a facsimile.

668
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:17,939
A rather troublesome one, at that.

669
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:20,317
You're lying to me.

670
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:22,444
<i>I'm afraid he's not.</i>

671
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:25,530
<i>You were created in her image, as was I.</i>

672
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:28,992
<i>My likeness and voice
were based on childhood recordings</i>

673
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:32,120
<i>of Alicia Marcus, made by her father.</i>

674
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:36,207
<i>Your genetic structure is based on her DNA,</i>

675
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:39,210
<i>tweaked to avoid the Progeria aging disease</i>

676
01:20:39,294 --> 01:20:40,545
<i>that afflicted her.</i>

677
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:43,089
<i>I'm the child she was.</i>

678
01:20:43,173 --> 01:20:45,008
<i>You are the woman she would have been.</i>

679
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:46,926
No.

680
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:49,095
You are so much better

681
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,972
than I ever could be.

682
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:52,932
I let this happen.

683
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,268
I was weak.

684
01:20:56,186 --> 01:20:58,021
You cannot afford to be.

685
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,148
<i>Time is running out, Alice.</i>

686
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:02,233
How touching.

687
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:06,654
The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.

688
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:09,074
Not that it will do you any good.

689
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:11,242
I've been ahead of you every step of the way.

690
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:12,452
You've changed nothing.

691
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,037
You've saved no one.

692
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:15,747
The world will still be cleansed,

693
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:18,124
and the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

694
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,585
The only difference is,
I'll no longer have to listen

695
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:22,837
to your self-righteous whining.

696
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:25,673
When you uploaded that file
to the Red Queen's data stream,

697
01:21:25,799 --> 01:21:27,592
you turned against the corporation.

698
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:30,595
When the rest of the board awake,
you will be replaced,

699
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:33,181
and I will assume complete control.

700
01:21:33,515 --> 01:21:36,518
I still own 50% of this company.

701
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:39,771
And what do you intend to do with that?

702
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:43,149
You are co-owner of this corporation,

703
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,068
but Wesker...

704
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,487
Wesker is still an employee.

705
01:21:47,654 --> 01:21:49,239
I don't have to take your orders.

706
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:51,616
- My loyalties are with him.
- I know.

707
01:21:53,118 --> 01:21:55,078
Albert Wesker,

708
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:57,288
you're fired.

709
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:21,729
How did you know it was me?

710
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:23,523
You're still alive.

711
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:28,736
Hey, please. It wasn't like I had a choice.

712
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:31,156
They made me do it.

713
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:33,283
Don't worry. I'm not gonna kill you.

714
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:40,248
Claire, it's me.

715
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:41,791
Sorry.

716
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:44,294
- Please.
- My love.

717
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:46,671
No, no, no!

718
01:22:48,006 --> 01:22:50,341
If you keep this trigger depressed,

719
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:52,802
you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

720
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:55,221
I should have killed you in Washington.

721
01:22:56,556 --> 01:22:57,682
Yeah.

722
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:03,229
He only has to evade you
for another few minutes,

723
01:23:04,147 --> 01:23:07,442
and the last remaining
human outposts will fall.

724
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:12,238
We need an intercept path
and the fastest way to the surface.

725
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:14,240
<i>Already done.</i>

726
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:18,036
If you release the antivirus,

727
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:23,333
it will kill all organisms
infected with the T-virus.

728
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,669
You know what that means, don't you?

729
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:28,671
For you?

730
01:23:28,922 --> 01:23:31,132
- I know.
- Alice, you can't.

731
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:33,051
I don't have a choice.

732
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:34,594
There has to be another way.

733
01:23:37,805 --> 01:23:38,932
You know there isn't.

734
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:41,142
<i>Four minutes and 33 seconds left.</i>

735
01:23:41,226 --> 01:23:42,352
<i>You have to hurry.</i>

736
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:28,856
Help me.

737
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:31,651
You don't need help, Wesker.

738
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:35,822
You're dying.

739
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:38,283
Just get on with it.

740
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:44,247
This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

741
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:48,084
Confirm DNA scan
and voice print identification.

742
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,086
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

743
01:24:50,378 --> 01:24:53,089
Confirm security override 4365.

744
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:54,841
<i>Override confirmed.</i>

745
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,884
You will now take yourself offline

746
01:24:57,051 --> 01:24:59,554
and place all functions
under my sole control.

747
01:24:59,721 --> 01:25:02,056
<i>As you wish. Shutting down now.</i>

748
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:03,933
<i>Dr. Isaacs.</i>

749
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:07,604
<i>- You and the Umbrella high command...</i>
- Yes?

750
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:10,607
<i>You are all going to die down here.</i>

751
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:17,488
Your little friend
won't be able to help you now.

752
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:19,282
And you can't run anymore.

753
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:24,370
I wasn't running.

754
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:12,807
Is that all you got?

755
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,435
'Cause if it is,

756
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:18,813
I'm gonna have to kill you.

757
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:10,197
We've played a long game, you and I,

758
01:30:11,866 --> 01:30:13,242
but now it's over.

759
01:30:14,368 --> 01:30:15,995
Yes.

760
01:30:17,914 --> 01:30:19,248
Yes, it is.

761
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:14,136
I made you.

762
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:15,888
Yeah.

763
01:31:16,847 --> 01:31:18,099
Big mistake.

764
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:27,024
Claire.

765
01:31:28,985 --> 01:31:30,861
Go. While there's still time.

766
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:33,322
Go. I'll be right behind you.

767
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,760
Your time's up.

768
01:32:39,263 --> 01:32:40,598
Alice!

769
01:32:41,348 --> 01:32:43,517
I brought them here. I brought them for you.

770
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:53,819
What the hell are you?

771
01:32:56,864 --> 01:32:58,574
I'm you, you idiot.

772
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:03,871
No.

773
01:33:05,081 --> 01:33:06,749
No.

774
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:09,293
No, that's not possible.

775
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:11,545
The real you.

776
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:14,048
No.

777
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,594
Liar! Abomination!

778
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:22,765
You dirty, filthy clone!

779
01:33:33,651 --> 01:33:36,112
I'm me. He's not me.

780
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:24,929
You did it, Alice.

781
01:35:25,429 --> 01:35:26,597
Alice.

782
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:30,267
You did it.

783
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:35,648
Why am I still alive?

784
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:36,857
I don't know.

785
01:35:42,655 --> 01:35:44,490
- What happened?
<i>- When Isaacs died,</i>

786
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:46,367
<i>I could bring myself back online</i>

787
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:49,453
<i>and stop the attacks
on the remaining human settlements.</i>

788
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:50,746
<i>You saved them.</i>

789
01:35:51,247 --> 01:35:53,582
- Why am I still alive?
<i>- The antivirus</i>

790
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:56,252
<i>only destroyed the T-virus within your body.</i>

791
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:58,587
<i>It didn't harm the healthy cells.</i>

792
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:00,297
<i>You are now free of infection.</i>

793
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:02,675
I thought I would die.

794
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:05,719
You and Alicia, you lied to me.

795
01:36:05,803 --> 01:36:08,389
<i>We had to know if you were willing
to make the sacrifice,</i>

796
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:10,391
<i>to give up your life for others.</i>

797
01:36:10,516 --> 01:36:13,394
<i>This was something no one at Umbrella
would have done.</i>

798
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:16,021
<i>Alicia Marcus was right about you.</i>

799
01:36:16,105 --> 01:36:17,815
<i>You were better than all of them.</i>

800
01:36:17,898 --> 01:36:19,149
I was one of them.

801
01:36:19,233 --> 01:36:22,278
I was created by Umbrella,
just an instrument for them.

802
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:26,740
<i>No. You became something more
than they could ever have anticipated.</i>

803
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:30,494
<i>The clone became more human
than they ever could be.</i>

804
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:33,372
<i>And you have one more step to make.</i>

805
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:37,126
What do you mean?

806
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,091
<i>Before she died,</i>

807
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:46,260
<i>Alicia downloaded her memories</i>

808
01:36:46,802 --> 01:36:47,970
<i>for you.</i>

809
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:50,180
<i>The childhood you never had</i>

810
01:36:54,393 --> 01:36:57,313
<i>combined with the woman
she could never become.</i>

811
01:37:30,137 --> 01:37:32,348
<i>When the T-virus spread across the Earth,</i>

812
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:34,350
<i>it did so at the speed of the modern world,</i>

813
01:37:34,933 --> 01:37:37,019
<i>carried by jetliners across the globe.</i>

814
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:41,357
<i>The antivirus is airborne,
spread by the winds.</i>

815
01:37:42,483 --> 01:37:44,943
<i>It could take years for it to reach
every corner of the Earth.</i>

816
01:37:46,487 --> 01:37:48,781
<i>Until then, my work is not done.</i>

817
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:57,748
<i>My name is Alice.</i>

818
01:46:36,308 --> 01:46:38,518
<i>You are all going to die down here.</i>
